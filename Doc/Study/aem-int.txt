Dispatcher in CQ5
  - Caching
  - Load-balancing

Package - zip file contains the content in the form of file-system serialization

Bundle - Collection of classes, jars and config files

OSGi - Open System Gateway initiative

OSGI is a framework which allows modular development of applications using java. small reusable components(bundle) each are independently start & stop

States of OSGi- Installed, Resolved(all classes that the buncle needs are available), Starting, Active, Stopping, Uninstalled

OSGi vs jar
- MANIFEST.MF
- Versions - simutaneously access different versions
- Bundle depend on another Bundle. Ensure that dependencies are met before the bundle is 'resolved'
- Activator.java - optinal listener class to nitified of buncle start and stop event

Representational State Transfer (REST)
The publish environment is usually kept in a Demilitarized Zone (DMZ)

What design patterns are used in AEM?
	Since AEM is built using OSGI, many of the design patterns for OSGI are valid. Some of these design patterns are Singleton (Service), Adapter Service, Resource Adapter Service, and Whiteboard. Also, since AEM is modular, you should be able to use any design pattern in your application.
