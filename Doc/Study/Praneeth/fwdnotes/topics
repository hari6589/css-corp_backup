String why immutatble?
1.To reduce the duplicates of objects in String pool.
2.Using litrals and new String();
3.using Literals String s="test";
	it will store in String pool.
4.If we create String s = new String();
every time you create String object it will generate an new String in String pool.

5.If Two literals have same string attribute if compare

what is idempotenet in http methods

hashmap allow duplicates?

why do we go for dependency injection?
factroydesing pattern
polymarphism
relate runtimepolymorphism and dependencyinjection


how readonly list with out adding any elements

diff btw restfull and soap

to update will work as post 
why we use put? then


Reverse a string without loop:
static String reverse(String str) {
   if(str.length() == 0)
     return "";
   return str.charAt(str.length() - 1) +    reverse(str.substring(0,str.length()-1));
 }
 
 using stringbuilder:
 static String reverse(String str){
	if(str.isEmpty() || str == null) return str; 
	return new StringBuilder(str).reverse().toString(); 
} 

*GroupBy method in sql
SampleQuery:

SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country FROM Customers GROUP BY Country;

CustomerID   Country
2			India
6   		China
8			America

orderBy:
By default it will sort in ascending order.
SELECT * FROM Customers ORDER BY  Country desc;

To order by query:
id		Country
1		Venuzula
2		vicotria




Hibernate versining Concepet:
============================
If an object is save in database,we can modify the object any no of times you want.
And if we want to check that how many number of times object being modifed.
We need to apply the Versioning concept.

SingletonDesing Pattern:
-----------------------
Singleton pattern restricts the instantiation of a class and ensures that only one instance of the class exists in the java virtual machine.
The singleton class must provide a global access point to get the instance of the class.
Singleton pattern is used for logging, drivers objects, caching and thread pool.

Steps to make a class as singleTonDesing pattern:
=====================================================
	*Private Counstructor to restrict the instantiation of class from outside the class.
	*Private static variable that is the only instance of the class.
	*public static method returns the instatnce of the class and it is the access point for outer world to get the instance of the class.

	Types and approaches of singleton desing patterns:
	====================================================
1Eager initialization
2Static block initialization
3Lazy Initialization
4Thread Safe Singleton
5Bill Pugh Singleton Implementation
6Using Reflection to destroy Singleton Pattern
