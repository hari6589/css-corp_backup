Servlet Listener:
Event is occurrence of something, in web application world an event can be initialization of application, destroying an application, request from client, creating/destroying a session, attribute modification in session etc.

transient:
==========
To make a memmber variable as transient to avoid it as a serializable while trasnfer through network when persisted as stream bytes.	

Actually the object need to transfer through network in stream bytes by serilazation.so it converts the state of object to byte stream using serilazation.


Volitile:
=========
Declaring a volatile Java variable means: The value of this variable will never be cached thread-locally: all reads and writes will go straight to "main memory";
Access to the variable acts as though it is enclosed in a synchronized block, synchronized on itself.

MethodOverridding:

*methodoverriding is allowing the method with same method name with same return type or child type of the base class method return type
*The method name of the overridden method and overridding method should be same .
*The overridding method scope should be lower than or equal scope but should not more than overridden method.
*private ,static ,final methods are not allowed for method overridding.
*if The overridding method throws any exception that should not be higher than the overridden method.

Method overloading:
*Methodoverloading is the no.of paremeters and the types of parameters and order of parameters.
*In method overloading if we change the return type it doesn't comes under the methodoverloading..

Dynamic polymorphism will implment in method overrridding.

Static polymorphism will implement in method overloading.

FactoryMethod:
The method that returns the instance of a class is known as factory method
