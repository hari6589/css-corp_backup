+<![CDATA[<h2>How Do You Know if You Need New Tires&#63;</h2>
+<p>You need to be aware of three things when deciding if you need new tires&#58; tread wear, exposure to the elements and tire age.</p>
+<h2>Tread Wear</h2>
+<p><a href="/pennytiretest/">Who says a penny doesn&#8217;t buy you anything&#63;</a> With this easy test, a penny can buy you peace of mind when it comes to your tires and safety. Place a penny head first into several tread grooves across the tire. If you always see the top of Lincoln&#8217;s head, your treads are shallow and worn. If this is the case, your tires need to be replaced. If part of Lincoln&#8217;s head is always covered by the tread, you have more than 2&#47;32 of an inch of tread depth remaining. This means you probably don&#8217;t need new tires.</p>
+<h2>Why Worry About Tread Wear&#63;</h2>
+<p>The most important reason to worry about tread wear is safety. When your tire treads are worn, your car may respond poorly in adverse weather conditions like rain and snow. With good treads your car will grip the road better. Also, having insufficient tread is considered illegal in many states. And finally, worn treads can make other parts of your car wear prematurely.</p>
+<h2>Exposure to the Elements</h2>
+<p>Exposure to heat and the sun&#8217;s ultraviolet rays may cause structural changes to your tires. These changes are not usually a concern in moderate climates.</p>
+<h2>Tire Age</h2>
+<p>How old are your tires&#63; Regardless of tread wear, vehicle manufacturers generally recommend you replace your tires at six years. Most tire manufacturers recommend you replace your tires at 10 years. Check the manufacturer&#8217;s recommendations on your specific tires.</p>
+<h2>I Need New Tires</h2>
+<p>When it&#8217;s time to change your tires, your Firestone Complete Auto Care dealer wants to make purchasing a new set as simple as possible. We have the best selection of quality tires to fit your vehicle, your budget and your driving style. From economy to ultra high performance tires &#8212; in the size you need from brands you trust, including our well&#45;known Bridgestone and Firestone brands &#8212; you can <a href="/tires/">Find What You Need Right Here</a>.</p>]]>

+<![CDATA[<p>Getting the most out of your tire investment includes the proper care and maintenance that you can do along with the tire&#45;related services we do at Firestone Complete Auto Care. Free tire inspections by one of our tire professionals are always available, but learn what you can do to get better mileage and performance.</p>
+<h2>What You Should Know About Tires</h2>
+<p>There is valuable information about your tires printed right on the sidewall&#33;</p>
+<img alt="Tire Evaluation" src="/static-fcac/images/cf/articles/tire-sidewall-information.jpg" />
+<h2>Simple Steps to Better Tire Care</h2>
+<a href="http://www.tiresafety.com/" class="left" rel="external nofollow"><img alt="Tire Safety" src="/static-fcac/images/cf/articles/tire-safety-logo.png" /></a>
+<p>Did you know tires can lose 1 <abbr title="pounds per square inch">psi</abbr> of air pressure &#40;pounds per square inch&#41; per month under normal conditions&#63; That&#8217;s why checking your tires on a regular basis is one of the easiest things you can do to maintain your investment. For more helpful tips, visit <a href="http://www.tiresafety.com/" rel="external nofollow">TireSafety.com</a>.</p>
+<h2>4&#45;Tire Rotation</h2>
+<p>Did you know that front tires wear out almost twice as fast as rear tires on a front&#45;wheel drive vehicle&#63; Also keep in mind that uneven tire wear may be due to mechanical problems like a misaligned suspension. On average, tires should be rotated every 5,000 miles and more frequently for high performance tires.</p>
+<img alt="Tire Rotation" src="/static-fcac/images/cf/articles/tire-rotation-diagram.jpg" />
+<h2>Wheel Balancing</h2>
+<p>Do you feel steering wheel vibration between 50 and 70 miles per hour&#63; Out of balance wheels can create poor handling and a significant reduction in fuel mileage. We recommend wheel balancing with every tire rotation.</p>
+<h2>Valve Stem Replacement</h2>
+<p>Loss of air pressure is the number one factor in reduced tire life. When tire valves begin to weather and crack, and&#47;or when valve caps are missing, air seepage is likely to occur. Tire valves should be replaced whenever you purchase new tubeless tires.</p>
+<h2>Tire Installation</h2>
+<p>The variety of tire sizes, designs and specialty wheel applications is growing. That makes it necessary to have qualified tire professionals do the work. Every Firestone Complete Auto Care technician is trained in proper installation techniques and uses state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art mounting equipment.</p>
+<h2>Flat Repair</h2>
+<p>When you bring a damaged tire to Firestone Complete Auto Care, we always start with a full inspection. If your tire can be repaired, your tire technician will fill the damaged area, seal the inner liner, then re&#45;check for leaks before re&#45;installing the tire.</p>
+<h2>What&#8217;s Inside Your Tire&#63;</h2>
+<p>Some basic construction features of a common radial tire&#58;</p>

+<![CDATA[<h2>Do You Need New Tires&#63;</h2>
+<p>You need to be aware of three things when <a href="/cf/tires/time-for-new-tires-know-the-signs/">deciding if you need new tires</a>&#58; tread wear, exposure to the elements and tire age.</p>
+<h2>Air Pressure</h2>
+<p><a href="/cf/tires/find-your-vehicles-recommended-tire-pressure/">Keeping the correct air pressure</a> in your tires helps your tires last longer, helps your car handle better and safer, and helps you save money on fuel. You may use the tool below to view the manufacturer recommended inflations for standard sized tires on your vehicle.</p>
+<h2>Load Index</h2>
+<p>The <a href="/cf/tires/learn-about-tire-load-index/">load index</a> indicates the load&#45;carrying capacity of a tire. In other words, it tells you how much weight your tire can support.</p>
+<h2>Speed Rating</h2>
+<p>The <a href="/cf/tires/tire-speed-rating-explained/">speed rating</a> of a tire indicates the speed category &#40;or range of speeds&#41; at which the tire can carry a load under specified service conditions.</p>
+<h2>Tire Pressure Monitoring System &#40;TPMS&#41;</h2>
+<p><a href="/cf/tires/what-is-a-tire-pressure-monitoring-system-tpms/"><abbr title="Tire Pressure Monitoring System">TPMS</abbr></a> is an electronic system that alerts you with a dashboard indicator light when your car&#8217;s tire pressure falls to the point of needing inflation.</p>
+<h2>Purchasing and Mounting Tires</h2>
+<p>Generally, <a href="/cf/tires/buying-new-tires-tire-mounting-tips/">new tires</a> provide increased resistance to hydroplaning due to their full tread depth. With new tires on the rear, an oversteer skidding condition may be more easily avoided.</p>

+    <p><abbr title="Tire Pressure Monitoring System">TPMS</abbr>, Tire Pressure Monitoring System, is an electronic system to monitor the air pressure inside a tire.</p>
+    <h2>Why Is TPMS Necessary&#63;</h2>
+    <p>To help drivers recognize the importance of tire pressure safety and maintenance, Congress passed the <abbr title="Transportation Recall Enhancement, Accountability, and Documentation">TREAD</abbr> act,
+    which requires most vehicles made in 2006&#45;07 and ALL made thereafter to be TPMS equipped.</p>
+    <h2>How Does TPMS Work&#63;</h2>
+    <p>To help you make informed decisions about TPMS, it&#8217;s important to know how each system&mdash;Direct and Indirect&mdash;works. Direct uses a sensor located in the tire assembly that transmits data to your vehicle&#8217;s computer system. It measures the tire&#8217;s pressure and notifies the driver when pressure drops 25 percent or more below the manufacturer&#8217;s recommended level. Indirect TPMS uses the Antilock Braking System &#40;ABS&#41; to gauge tire pressure by measuring the difference in diameter of each tire. Our Firestone Complete Auto Care expert technicians can tell you which system your vehicle uses.</p>
+    <h2>What Are the Benefits of TPMS&#63;</h2>
+    <p>TPMS notifies you when your vehicle&#8217;s tire pressure is low or is going flat. By helping you maintain proper tire pressure, TPMS can increase your safety on the road by improving your vehicle&#8217;s handling, decreasing tire wear, reducing braking distance and bettering fuel economy.</p>
+    <h2>Is Your Vehicle Equipped with TPMS&#63;</h2>
+    <p>Your vehicle has TPMS if the &#8220;low tire pressure&#8221; warning light appears on your dash when the key is turned to the &#34;on&#34; position.</p>
+    <h2>How Can Our Technicians Help&#63;</h2>
+    <p>If your vehicle&#8217;s TPMS warning indicator light comes on, there is a tire pressure problem.
+    Stop into Firestone Complete Auto Care and our technicians will take care of your needs. They&#8217;ll check your vehicle&#8217;s tire pressure
+    and perform a systems test on all of your tire sensors to diagnose the problem. Once our technicians address your vehicle&#8217;s tire needs, they&#8217;ll then suggest the proper maintenance to get you back on the road.</p>
+    <h2>Why Does Tire Maintenance with Direct TPMS Cost More&#63;</h2>
+    <p>Direct TPMS equipped tires cost slightly more to maintain than non&#45;equipped tires because proper care requires extra parts and labor. The valve service kit, which includes the valve core, cap, nut and o&#45;ring &#40;seal&#41;, must always be replaced when a tire is dismounted for service or replacement. The service kit costs &#36;5&#45;&#36;10 per wheel on most vehicles. A special TPMS tool and additional time are also needed to check and reset the sensor system. In the event pressure sensors need to be replaced,
+    the cost ranges from &#36;50&#45;&#36;250 each depending on vehicle type.</p>

+    <h2>Why Correct Tire Pressure Matters</h2>
+    <p>Keeping the correct air pressure in your tires helps your tires last longer, helps your car handle better and safer, and helps you save money on fuel.</p>
+    <h2>Check Tire Pressure Regularly</h2>
+    <p>Most people forget about their tires until something goes wrong. The truth is, tires lose pressure daily. In cool weather, a tire will typically lose one or two pounds of air per month. In warm weather, tires lose even more air. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s recommended that you check air pressure every other time you stop to fill up your gas tank. Keep in mind that many vehicles have different tire pressures on the front and rear axle. And don&#8217;t forget to check the pressure in your spare tire.</p>
+    <h2>What Is the Correct Pressure&#63;</h2>
+    <p>The first place to look for the correct air pressure for your specific tires is your vehicle owner&#8217;s manual. Correct air pressure should also be listed on the tire placard attached to the vehicle door edge, doorpost, glove box door or fuel door.</p>

+    </div>
+    <p>Generally, new tires provide increased resistance to hydroplaning due to their full tread depth. With new tires on the rear, an oversteer skidding condition may be more easily avoided.</p>
+    <p>Whether your vehicle is front&#45;, rear&#45;, or all&#45;wheel drive, if your rear tires lose traction because of hydroplaning on a wet road, an oversteer skidding condition may result and lead to loss of control, particularly in a turn.</p>
+    <p>Additional or alternate recommendations may apply for some vehicles. Always refer to and follow the vehicle manufacturer&#8217;s tire replacement and tire application recommendations; consult  your vehicle owner&#8217;s manual and tire information placard.</p>
+    <p>Driving your vehicle with an improper mix of tires is dangerous. Your vehicle&#8217;s handling characteristics can be seriously affected. You could have an accident resulting in serious personal injury or death. Consult your vehicle owner&#8217;s manual, tire information placard, and a qualified service professional for proper tire replacement.</p>

+<content>
+<![CDATA[<h2>What Is the Proper Inflation for My Tires&#63;</h2>
+<p>Bridgestone&#47;Firestone recommends using the tire pressure that the vehicle manufacturer recommends. This information located on the Tire Information Placard is normally located on the inside driver&#8217;s door jamb. We suggest you do not deviate from this tire pressure. Pressure requirements may change when plus sizing tires. You may use the <a href="/tires/tirepressure.jsp">Recommended Tire Pressure Lookup Tool</a> to view the manufacturer recommended inflations for standard sized tires on your vehicle.</p>
+<h2>What Is the Mileage Warranty on My Original Equipment &#40;O.E.&#41; Tires&#63;</h2>
+<p><abbr title="Original Equipment">O.E.</abbr> tires are designed to the vehicle manufacturer&#8217;s specifications and do not offer a mileage warranty. However, your tires are warranted for workmanship and material defects.</p>
+<h2>What Is the Rolling Resistance of My Tires&#63;</h2>
+<p>Rolling resistance has traditionally been measured through <abbr title="Society of Automotive Engineers">SAE</abbr> test procedure J1269. It measures the force required to roll a tire against a dynamometer at a fixed speed of 50 <abbr title="miles per hour">mph</abbr>. Within Bridgestone&#47;Firestone, we have over 1,300 passenger and light truck products in the Bridgestone line alone and, conceivably, each one could have a different rolling resistance. The tread compound is a major factor, but construction, size, and even tread pattern can have an influence. At least 3 tires must be run in each configuration to get a good average. At approximately 1 hour per rolling resistance test, this amounts to 3,900 hours or over 6 months just to run the Bridgestone brand.</p>
+<p>This explains why these values are estimated. We have some data, however it frequently does not line up with those sizes or patterns requested. Therefore, estimation is required.</p>
+<p>These estimates are made by independent organizations. Bridgestone&#47;Firestone does not test for rolling resistance.</p>
+<h2>What Is Meant by Speed Rating&#63;</h2>
+<p>The speed rating of a tire indicates the speed category &#40;or range of speeds&#41; at which the tire can carry a load under specified service conditions. The speed rating system used today was developed in Europe in response to the need to control the safe performance of tires at standardized speeds. A letter from A to Z symbolizes a tire&#8217;s certified speed rating, ranging from 5 <abbr title="kilometers per hour">km&#47;h</abbr> &#40;3 mph&#41; to above 300 km&#47;h &#40;186 mph&#41;. This rating system, listed below, describes the top speed for which a tire is certified. It does not indicate the total performance capability of a tire.</p>
+<p>When this speed rating system was originally developed, the Unlimited V category of over 210 km&#47;h &#40;130 mph&#41; was the top speed rating a tire could achieve.</p>
+<p>As manufacturers made more tires that did not fit this category, it was necessary to better regulate performance at standardized speeds to ensure safety. The Limited V category of 250 km/h &#40;149 mph&#41; was then created, and the Z speed rating was added as the top speed rating that a tire could achieve. W and Y limited speed symbols have been added as higher speed categories.</p>
+<p>Always consult the manufacturer for the maximum speed of Unlimited Z tires. Speed rating is identified as a part of the tire&#8217;s sizing or service description.</p>
+<p>In the latest attempt to standardize tire designations, all ratings except Unlimited ZR incorporate the speed symbol and load index as the tire&#8217;s service description. For example&#58;</p>

+        <h2>What Does UTQG Mean&#63;</h2>
+        <h3>Uniform Tire Quality Grading</h3>
+<p><abbr title="Uniform Tire Quality Grading">UTQG</abbr> is intended to provide simple, comparative data for your use in making an informed buying decision. However, the ratings are based upon test results achieved under very specific conditions. As a result, misinterpreting the comparative data as it relates specifically to your particular driving habits, conditions, etc., is a possibility.  UTQG designates the comparative performance levels of a tire based upon government&#45;specified tests. Tire manufacturers and brand name owners are required to grade regular and all&#45;season tires in three categories&#58; Treadwear, Traction, and Temperature.</p>
+<h3>DOT Quality Grades</h3>
+<p>All passenger car tires must conform to Federal Safety Requirements in addition to these grades.</p>
+<h3>Treadwear</h3>
+<p>The treadwear grade is a comparative grade assigned by the manufacturer based on the wear rate of a tire when tested under controlled conditions on a course that meets government&#45;specified requirements. For example, a tire graded 150 would wear one and a half &#40;1 1&#47;2&#41; times as well as a tire graded 100 under the controlled test conditions. The relative performance of tires depends upon the actual conditions of their use and may depart significantly from the norm due to variations in driving habits, service practices and differences in road characteristics.</p>
+<h3>Traction AA, A, B, C</h3>
+<p>The traction grade is based on wet skid tests of a tire on government&#45;specified concrete and asphalt surfaces. The traction grade is based on a straight&#45;ahead wet braking traction test and does not include a cornering traction test. The comparative tire grade letters, AA, A, B, and C &#40;AA being the highest and C being the lowest&#41; represent the tire&#8217;s ability to stop the vehicle on wet pavement under the controlled test conditions. Ice and snow traction capabilities are not tested.</p>
+<strong>WARNING&#58;</strong>
+<p>The traction grade assigned is based on braking &#40;straight ahead&#41; traction test and does not include cornering &#40;turning&#41; traction.</p>
+<h3>Temperature A, B, C</h3>
+<p>The temperature grade is based on an indoor, high&#45;speed test that meets government&#45;specified requirements. The comparative grade letters, A, B, and C &#40;A being the highest and C being the lowest&#41; represent the tire&#8217;s resistance to the generation of heat and its ability to dissipate heat when tested under controlled conditions on a specified indoor laboratory test wheel.</p>
+<p>Sustained high temperature can cause the material of the tire to degenerate and reduce tire life, and excessive temperature can lead to sudden tire failure. The grade C corresponds to a level of performance which all passenger car tires must meet under the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 109. Grades A and B represent higher levels of performance on the laboratory test wheel than the minimum required by law.</p>
+<strong>WARNING&#58;</strong>
+<p>The temperature grade is established for a tire that is properly inflated and not overloaded. Excessive speed, under inflation, or excessive loading, either separately or in combination, can cause heat buildup and possible tire failure.</p>
+<h3>Example &#35;1&#58;</h3>
+<p>A tire with the ratings of TREADWEAR 80, TRACTION B, TEMPERATURE C, is interpreted by the manufacturer as having&#58;</p>
+<ul>
+    <li>TREADWEAR grade less than that of a tire graded 100.</li>
+    <li>TRACTION capability greater than tires of C grade, but not as good as tires of AA or A grade.</li>
+    <li>TEMPERATURE performance on the laboratory high&#45;speed test greater than required by the government standards, but less than tires graded B or A.</li>
+</ul>
+<h3>Example #2&#58;</h3>
+<p>A tire with same brand name and same construction type with ratings of TREADWEAR 160, TRACTION A, TEMPERATURE B, compares to the tire in example #1 as follows&#58;</p>
+<ul>
+    <li>TREADWEAR is graded two times better than the tire in example &#35;1.</li>
+    <li>Wet TRACTION and TEMPERATURE are better than the tire in example &#35;1.</li>
+</ul>
+<strong>IMPORTANT NOTE</strong>
+<p>Keep in mind that comparing the performance of various tires is too complex to be based exclusively on UTQG grades.</p>
+<ul>
+    <li>UTQG grades are not government grades. They are manufacturer grades that are not based on head&#45;to&#45;head interbrand testing. Test data is not typically submitted to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.</li>
+    <li>Treadwear grades are not a guarantee for a given mileage warranty, or an indicator of overall tire quality. Treadwear grades are assigned by the manufacturer for comparison purposes within the same brand names and construction types only.</li>
+    <li>UTQG grades are not safety ratings. Overall tire quality and safety are not graded. Tire selection based on any one, two, or even three UTQG ratings may not satisfy your needs.</li>
+    <li>One brand name of tires cannot be considered superior or inferior to another brand name of tires based solely on UTQG grades.</li>
+    <li>UTQG grades are not required for snow tires, light truck tires and maximum traction tires.</li>
+    <li>UTQG is used but not required in Canada.</li>
+</ul>
+<h2>What Do I Need to Know About Tire Repair&#63;</h2>
+<p>Driving an improperly repaired tire is dangerous. An improper repair can be unreliable or permit further damage to the tire. The tire may suddenly fail, causing serious personal injury or death. A complete inspection and repair of your tire in accordance with Rubber Manufacturers Association &#40;<abbr title="Rubber Manufacturers Association">RMA</abbr>&#41; procedures should be conducted by a qualified tire service professional.</p>
+<p>A proper tire repair includes the following&#58;</p>
+<ul>
+    <li><strong>The tire is demounted from the wheel for a complete inspection, inside and out.</strong> Some damage to the tire may only be evident on the interior of the tire.</li>
+    <li><strong>The puncture injury is &#188; inch &#40;6 <abbr title="millimeters">mm</abbr>&#41; or less and must be within the tread area.</strong> This helps ensure the long&#45;term tire and repair durability.</li>
+    <li><strong>A patch is applied to the interior of the tire and the puncture hole is filled with a suitable plug&#47;stem filler.</strong> This helps ensure that the interior of the tire is adequately sealed to prevent inflation pressure loss and prevents contamination of the steel belts and other plies from the elements &#40;such as water&#41; in the outside world.</li>
+</ul>
+<p>Additional notes about tire repairs&#58;</p>
+<ul>
+    <li>
+      Not all punctured or damaged tires can be properly repaired; consequently, some tires must be replaced. NEVER repair a tire with any of the following conditions&#58;
+      <ul>
+        <li>Wear to the tire&#8217;s built&#45;in treadwear indicators or to 2&#47;32 inch &#40;1.6 mm&#41; remaining tread depth in any area of the tread.</li>
+        <li>With a puncture larger than &frac14; inch &#40;6 mm&#41;.</li>
+        <li>With a puncture or other damage outside the repairable tread area.</li>
+        <li>With a pre&#45;existing, improper repair.</li>
+      </ul>
+    </li>
+    <li>Any tire repair done without removing the tire from the wheel is improper. The tire must be demounted from the wheel and the interior inspected for damage that may not be evident on the exterior of the tire.</li>
+    <li>Using only a plug&#47;stem, or using only a patch, is not a safe or proper repair. A patch must be applied to the interior of the tire and the puncture hole must be filled with a suitable plug&#47;stem filler to prevent inflation pressure loss and contamination of the steel belts and other plies.</li>
+    <li>NEVER substitute a tube for a proper repair or to remedy an improper repair.</li>
+    <li>Tubes, like tires, should only be repaired by a qualified tire service professional.</li>
+    <li>Some vehicle manufacturers do not recommend using repaired tires. Consult your vehicle owner&#8217;s manual or contact the vehicle manufacturer before operating a repaired tire on your vehicle.</li>
+    <li>The tire&#8217;s speed rating is void if the tire is repaired, retreaded, damaged, abused, or otherwise altered from its original condition. It should be treated as a non&#45;speed rated tire.</li>
+</ul>
+<h2>What Is the Repairable Area of a Non&#45;RFT &#40;Run Flat&#41; Tire&#63;</h2>
+<p>We only repair tires in accordance with the <abbr title="Rubber Manufacturers Association">RMA</abbr> recommended procedures. Some punctures cannot be seen with the naked eye and other measures are taken to find such punctures &#40;soapy water and tire water tubs&#41;.</p>
+<h2>What Is the Repairable Area of an RFT &#40;Run Flat&#41; Tire&#63;</h2>
+<p>No tire, regardless of its design or quality, is indestructible. <abbr title="Run Flat">RFT</abbr> tires can be ultimately rendered unusable due to a puncture or other road hazard as well as from improper run&#45;flat or low pressure operation. Some punctures may be repaired under certain circumstances, with restrictions and subject to prescribed procedures.</p>
+<p>When driven flat or with low pressure, factors affecting reparability include vehicle speed, load, handling and maneuvering; the amount of inflation pressure lost; and ambient temperature. In any situation, the extent and location of direct damage from a puncturing object or other road hazard are also critical factors.</p>
+<p>RFT tires are not repairable in any of the following situations&#58;</p>
+<ul>
+    <li>If the tire is described as, &#8220;Do Not Repair&#8221; on the sidewall.</li>
+    <li>If the tire was operated with inflation pressure less than 15 <abbr title="pounds per square inch">psi</abbr> &#40;100 <abbr title="kilopascal">kPa</abbr>&#41;.</li>
+    <li>Abrasion or other damage is present on the exterior tread, sidewall or bead areas.</li>
+    <li>Abrasion, wrinkling, or separation is present on the tire interior.</li>
+    <li>Any condition or damage is present that disqualifies repair of a conventional tire.</li>
+</ul>
+<p>Run&#45;Flat Certified Retailers will fully inspect your tire, inside and out, to determine if the tire can be repaired. Tire damage is not always visible from the outside and the tire must be removed from the wheel for a complete inspection.</p>
+<p>Note&#58; Some vehicle manufacturers recommend not using repaired tires. Such recommendations apply to RFT tires. Use of RFT tires deemed non&#45;repairable may result in damage to the vehicle, injury, or death. Consult your vehicle owner&#8217;s manual or contact the vehicle manufacturer before operating a repaired tire on your vehicle.</p>
+<h2>Why Did My Tires Wear So Quickly&#63;</h2>
+<p>Premature tire wear may be caused by many factors other than tire rotation. Some examples are as follows&#58; improper inflation, driving conditions, misaligned vehicles, worn vehicle parts and many other reasons.</p>
+<p>Without physically inspecting the tires it is difficult to make a determination as to why your tires wore prematurely. Please visit our location and have one of our trained professionals inspect your tires free of charge.</p>
+<h2>Does Nitrogen Make a Difference in Tires&#63;</h2>
+<p>Recently, some tire shops and filling stations have been offering Nitrogen &#40;N2&#41; as an inflation gas for passenger and light truck tires. Nitrogen is acceptable as an inflation gas for use in Bridgestone and Firestone passenger, light truck, and truck tires.</p>
+<p>Bridgestone and Firestone tire innerliners are designed to act as pressure retention devices, specifically with the use of air, providing durability for the life of the tire and restricting air loss due to permeability. Nitrogen will not cause any detrimental reaction to the innerliner.</p>
+<p>Bridgestone&#47;Firestone passes no judgment on the claims stated by various Nitrogen suppliers.</p>
+<h2>Will You Beat Competitors&#8217; Prices&#63;</h2>
+<p>Our Priced Right Guarantee means we&#8217;ll match any comparable tire price, or we&#8217;ll refund 150&#37; of the price difference on your tire purchase within 30 days.</p>
+<p>This guarantee extends to the Customer, within thirty &#40;30&#41; days after the date of purchase, a refund of 150&#37; of the difference between a current locally&#45;advertised lower price on a similar make&#47;model tire and the price of a tire purchased from a Firestone Complete Auto Care store. Customer must provide a current local advertisement. This guarantee excludes clearances, closeouts and catalogs. This refund is not to be combined with any other offer or used to reduce outstanding debt.</p>]]>

+<![CDATA[<p>The load index indicates the load&#45;carrying capacity of a tire.  In other words, it tells you how much weight your tire can support. For example, if a tire has a load index of 92, it can support 1,389 pounds at maximum air pressure. Multiply that by four tires &#40;4 x 1,389 &#61; 5,556 pounds&#41; to get your car&#8217;s maximum load&#45;carrying capacity. Never install tires with a lower load carrying capacity than the tires originally installed on your car in the factory.</p>

+<![CDATA[<h2>What Is Meant by Speed Rating&#63;</h2>
+<p>The speed rating of a tire indicates the speed category &#40;or range of speeds&#41; at which the tire can carry a load under specified service conditions. The speed rating system used today was developed in Europe in response to the need to control the safe performance of tires at standardized speeds. A letter from A to Z symbolizes a tire&#8217;s certified speed rating, ranging from 5 <abbr title="kilometers">km</abbr>&#47;<abbr title="hour">h</abbr> &#40;3<abbr title="miles per hour">mph</abbr>&#41; to above 300 km&#47;h &#40;186 mph&#41;. This rating system, listed below, describes the top speed for which a tire is certified. It does not indicate the total performance capability of a tire.</p>
+<p>When this speed rating system was originally developed, the Unlimited V category of over 210 km/h &#40;130 mph&#41; was the top speed rating a tire could achieve.</p>
+<p>As manufacturers made more tires that did not fit this category, it was necessary to better regulate performance at standardized speeds to ensure safety. The Limited V category of 250 km/h &#40;149 mph&#41; was then created, and the Z speed rating was added as the top speed rating that a tire could achieve. W and Y limited speed symbols have been added as higher speed categories.</p>
+<p>Always consult the manufacturer for the maximum speed of Unlimited Z tires. Speed rating is identified as a part of the tire&#8217;s sizing or service description.</p>
+<p>In the latest attempt to standardize tire designations, all ratings except Unlimited ZR incorporate the speed symbol and load index as the tire&#8217;s service description. For example&#58;</p>

+<![CDATA[<p>Here&#8217;s a no brainer&#58; hitting a pothole can damage your vehicle. Big time. The thing is, pothole damage is an every day road hazard and a tricky one at that, since potholes&#8217; presence may not be obvious. That is, until the deed is done.</p>
+<p>If your vehicle hits a deep, dreaded divot in the road, steering system misalignment to a full&#45;on tire puncture or bent rims may follow. Cue the &#8220;gulp.&#8221; But whether the damage is obvious or not, the problem needs reversing. And sooner, not later.</p>
+<p>When your vehicle experiences the sudden jolt from a pothole run&#45;in, timely inspection is required.

+<h2>Pothole damage. The dreaded reality.</h2>
+<p>Say you hit a pothole straight on. Or maybe you nicked one, just barely. Either way, your vehicle likely sustained some damage. But just how much depends on the pothole&#8217;s depth and your speed on impact. Sound like a bummer&#63; It is. Especially since only some vehicle damage &#8211; like a flat tire &#8211; is apparent. Other kinds, such as minor misalignment or damaged steering or suspension, aren&#8217;t always as clear. Yet, these problems can have long&#45;term, lousy effects. Think premature, uneven tire wear. Even costly, too&#45;soon tire replacement.</p>

That way, we can identify and correct the negative effects of pothole damage. And help save you from costlier damage to your car&#8217;s valuable parts.</p>
+<h2>There are some signs. When pothole damage occurs.</h2>
+<p><strong>Tires</strong>&#58; If your wheels ram into a pothole, your tire&#8217;s sidewall can bulge. Sound like bad news&#63; It is, and it needs a fast fix.</p>
+<p><strong>Rims</strong>&#58; Unless your car is equipped with older steel rims, they&#8217;re likely aluminum&#45;based. That means they&#8217;re susceptible to dents. And if the pothole damage comes from a deep depression, hit at high speed&#63; Bent rims may also be on the agenda. That&#8217;s where professional technicians at Firestone Complete Auto Care come in. Correcting the havoc&#63; That&#8217;s what we do.</p>
+<p><strong>Undercarriage</strong>&#58; Hitting a pothole can dent or puncture the undercarriage of your ride. In other words, fluid leaks and wear leading to rust formation are just the beginning. During a complete vehicle inspection, our technicians will look for woes of all kinds. That includes damage resulting from potholes.</p>
+<p><strong>Exhaust System</strong>&#58; Are weird noises coming from your exhaust system&#63; Uh&#45;oh. Hitting a pothole may have damaged your ride. Getting a complete vehicle inspection to assess the situation&#63; It&#8217;s imperative.</p>
+<h2>Avoiding pothole damage. Your vehicle&#8217;s best bet.</h2>
+<p>Want to avoid pothole problems entirely&#63; Who doesn&#8217;t&#63; The easy answer is to bypass them, period. Unfortunately, unexpected encounters with potholes are commonplace. Worse yet, some potholes aren&#8217;t very visible, and others appear out of nowhere. Here are some tips to help avoid pothole damage. After all, it&#8217;s wise.</p>
+<ul>
+ <li>A good starting point&#63; To maintain your manufacturer&#8217;s recommended tire air pressure since properly inflated tires provide the best buffer between broken, dipping pavement and your ride&#8217;s wheel rims. And over or under&#45;inflating your tires&#63; Neither is good&#58; too&#45;firm tires are as bad as too&#45;soft ones when it comes to preventing pothole damage.</li>
+ <li>Prevention is the best medicine. That&#8217;s why leaving enough space between you and the vehicle in front of you is key. That way, you&#8217;re more likely to spot potholes before they wreak havoc on your ride. Whenever it&#8217;s possible to safely avoid broken pavement, do.</li>
+ <li>During damp, inclement weather, it&#8217;s tough to judge the depth and size of a pothole &#8211; or see it at all. When driving during crummy weather, proceed at a reduced speed. That extra caution may help you identify driving hazards, such as potholes, before they can cause damage your vehicle.</li>

+    <h2>A fuel&#45;efficient, eco&#45;friendly alternative to compressed air.</h2>
+    <h3>Here&#8217;s how using Nitrogen in your tires can help you keep your car running newer, longer.</h3>
+<div class="col col-primary">
+    <img src="/static-fcac/images/cf/articles/nitrogen-tire-inflation-service.jpg" alt="Nitrogen Tire Inflation Service&#58; A fuel&#45;efficient, eco&#45;friendly alternative to compressed air." />
+    <h4>Tire Pressure</h4>
+    <p>Because of its larger molecular size, nitrogen migrates through a tire three to four times slower than oxygen. A tire filled with compressed air will lose 1 <abbr title="pounds per square inch">PSI</abbr> in less than a month; with nitrogen this could take three months or longer.</p>
+    <h4>Fuel Economy</h4>
+    <p>Proper tire pressure lessens rolling resistance and helps maintain optimum fuel economy between services.</p>
+    <h4>Tire Life</h4>
+    <p>Setting into your tire. It will also optimize your vehicle&#8217;s handling and ride characteristics.</p>
+    <h4>TPMS</h4>
+    <p>For vehicles equipped with a tire pressure monitoring system &#40;<abbr title="tire pressure monitoring system">TPMS</abbr>&#41;, nitrogen provides for more consistent tire pressure, reducing the likelihood of alerts triggered solely by fluctuations in outside temperature.&#8230;and it&#8217;s better for the environment&#33;</p>
+    <h4>Environment</h4>
+    <p>The optimal fuel economy you can maintain more easily with nitrogen will produce less air pollution and less greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
+    <p>Remember, just because your tires are filled with Nitrogen doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t top them off with regular air. It&#8217;s best to use Nitrogen in your tires whenever possible, but if you run into a situation where you can&#8217;t get it, go ahead and top off with air. Then when you get a chance, head back to the store that inflated your tires with nitrogen for a refill. It is recommended that you continue to check your tire pressure periodically.</p>

+        <h2>Brake Basics</h2>
+        <h3>How do brakes work&#63;</h3>
+<p>Just as your ankle bone is connected to your foot bone, your brake system relies on each connected brake part to function successfully &#8212; and safely.</p>
+<p>Here&#8217;s a quick lesson&#58; By pressing down on the brake pedal, you activate the cylinder that delivers brake fluid to the calipers that then engage your brake pads. Your brake pads then apply pressure to the rotors, creating the friction needed to stop your car. You see, it&#8217;s all connected.</p>
+<p>All your brake parts work together to perform one important and crucial function&#58; safe and precise stopping power.</p>                                                        
+<h3>What is a Brake Inspection&#63;</h3>
+<p>Thorough, comprehensive, extensive, and methodical are just a few characteristics that describe our brake inspections. When we say brake inspection, we not only mean it, but we demonstrate it on every automobile we service. Because in order to detect a problem, we need technicians that not only can spot potential problems, but also have the know&#45;how and precision to regain brake awesomeness. When we&#8217;re finished, you&#8217;ll have total confidence knowing your ride has received a brake inspection that&#8217;s hard to match.</p>
+<p>Brake Inspection includes checking your brake&#58;</p>
+<ul>
+    <li>pads &#40;and&#47;or shoes&#41;</li>
+    <li>calipers</li>
+    <li>rotors &#40;and/or drums&#41;</li>
+    <li>wheel cylinders</li>
+    <li>hardware &#40;springs and adjusters&#41;</li>
+    <li>hoses</li>
+    <li>parking brake cables</li>
+    <li>fluid condition</li>
+    <li>wheel bearings and grease seals</li>
+    <li>master cylinder fluid exchange</li>                                                        
+</ul>
+<p><a href="/appointment/">Schedule your Complete Brake Inspection</a></p>
+<h3>How often should I have my brakes inspected&#63;</h3>
+<p>When you visit your doctor for a physical on a yearly basis, you&#8217;re being smart about your health. Same goes for your brakes. A yearly checkup will not only give you the confidence and guidance of our expert technicians, it will also provide you with the best opportunity to spot the necessary smaller repairs to avoid the bigger and more expensive ones. If you&#8217;re experiencing any warning symptoms, then a more immediate inspection may be required.</p>
+<p>Consult your owner&#8217;s manual for specific brake inspection intervals for your particular make and model.</p>
+<p><a href="/appointment/">Schedule a Brake Inspection Today</a></p>
+<h3>What are brake pads&#63;</h3>
+<p>Brake pads are the parts that contact your rotors and cause friction in order to stop your car.</p>
+<h3>What&#8217;s a rotor&#63;</h3>
+<p>The rotor is directly connected to each tire. To stop your car, the rotor must stop spinning. It stops spinning by friction created by the brake pad.</p>
+<h3>What&#8217;s a caliper&#63;</h3>
+<p>The caliper applies pressure and activates brake pads so the pads create contact with the rotors. The caliper requires brake fluid in order to function properly.</p>
+<h3>What&#8217;s a brake hose&#63;</h3>
+<p>When you press down on your brake pedal, brake fluid travels through the brake hose to each caliper, which puts the brake pads into action.</p>
+<h3>What exactly is brake fluid&#63;</h3>
+<p>Brake fluid is a crucial element needed to make your brakes operate successfully. When pressure is generated in the brake fluid lines, energy is distributed to your brake parts so they can perform their main job &#8212; stopping your car. If you have a brake fluid leak, your car could take longer to stop or, worse, won&#8217;t stop at all. If your vehicle has no brake fluid, you&#8217;re brakes won&#8217;t even operate. And that&#8217;s a scary situation we&#8217;d never wish on anybody.</p>]]>

+<![CDATA[
+    <h2>Brake Problem Symptoms</h2>
+    <h3>Why is it important to get my brakes inspected at the first sign of a symptom&#63;</h3>
+
+<p>When your car starts creating abnormal sounds, feelings or smells, start investigating the issue sooner rather than letting the condition worsen. Waiting will only lead to more expensive parts wearing out and requiring replacement. For example, rotors start to warp and become damaged when completely worn brake pads and shoes exceed their lifespan, shortening the life of healthy parts due to the metal on metal grinding that occurs.</p>
+<h3>What sounds, noises and sensations indicate I need brake repairs&#63;</h3>
+<p>Pay attention. Sounds, smells and sensations signal brake problems&#58;</p>
+<ul>
+    <li><strong>Screeching, grinding, squealing, rubbing and other eardrum piercing noises</strong> are common indicators that your brake pads &amp; shoes require inspection. This should be addressed before worn pads cause damage to other parts, which could result in more expensive repairs.
+    </li>
+    <li><strong>Vibration and pulsation in the pedal or your steering wheel.</strong> If this is a familiar feeling, your brake system is telling you something. Wait any longer, and your rotors might get warped from the metal on metal rubbing, potentially costing you a lot more in repair. Stop in as soon as possible if you are experiencing this unpleasant problem.
+    </li>
+    <li><strong>Pressing down farther to complete braking functions.</strong> This symptom is not as prevalent as it used to be, but if you&#8217;re pressing down farther than usual on your brake pedal to stop your car, requiring more pressure and time to perform the same stopping function, you have entered the first stage and sign of brake pad wear. Don&#8217;t play around with your brake pedal, you can only press so far before you&#8217;re in a frightening, &quot;I have no brakes&quot; predicament.
+    </li>
+    <li><strong>That pungent burning smell near your tires is screaming &quot;help!&quot;</strong> If you&#8217;re detecting noxious odors emitting from your tires, stop what you&#8217;re doing and please call or visit your local Firestone Complete Auto Care. Unfamiliar and pungent smells, such as what you&#8217;re experiencing, are not normal and could have dangerous consequences if you continue to drive under these unsafe conditions. Your best solution is our brake inspection to see what part of your braking system has been compromised while driving with this smelly symptom.
+    </li>
+    <li><strong>Brake warning light.</strong> If your brake warning light comes on visit us as soon as possible and ask us to perform a free brake inspection.</li>
+</ul>
+<h3>What other warning signs can I look for if I think my brakes are wearing out&#63;</h3>
+<p>There are many nuances to every car&#8217;s braking system, so we&#8217;d rather not overload you with worst case scenarios and model specific warning signs. We wouldn&#8217;t want you to go through the trouble &#8212; or worry &#8212; of diagnosing a symptom that is rare and hard to detect on your own.</p>
+<p>If you have questions about your braking system that weren&#8217;t described in the previous questions, please call your local Firestone Complete Auto Care to schedule a brake inspection. Once and inspection is done we&#8217;ll diagnose the problem and provide an estimate for repairs.</p>

+</p>
+<h3>How can I ensure my rotors last longer&#63;</h3>
+<p>First, we&#8217;d like to praise you for your foresight and great wisdom in your pursuit to protect your ride. Now that we&#8217;ve gotten that out of the way, let&#8217;s discuss the dos and don&#8217;ts of successful braking.</p>
+<ul>
+    <li><strong>Do&#8230; reduce the stop and go grind.</strong> The more city driving, the more stop and go, the quicker the brakes wear down. Simple as that. This type of driving can wear brake pads down faster, which can warp rotors more quickly. If you constantly drive like this, take your car in for at least one brake inspection a year to check for problems.
+    </li>
+    <li><strong>Do not&#8230; join the Brake Riders Brigade.</strong> Know someone with their foot riding the brake, even when no braking is necessary&#63; Don&#8217;t we all. Riding your brake is the sure&#45;fire way to wear your pads and warp your rotors from the excessive heat generated, especially at high speeds.
+    </li>
+    <li><strong>Do&#8230; cruise with the pace of traffic.</strong> Obeying speed limits with conservative driving pays off by preserving the life of your brake parts. So don&#8217;t tailgate, leave enough room to decelerate and you&#8217;ll be all set. Doing so will generate less heat, friction and wear. It&#8217;s a win&#45;win for both the pads and the rotors.
+    </li>
+    <li><strong>Do not&#8230; champion your aggressive habits.</strong> Aggressive driving leads to last minute braking. The result&#63; Excessive heat cooking your rotors. Continue driving this way and you&#8217;ll continue to pay more for the brake damage that ensues. Think about how you can avoid this driving scenario and you just might save more than just your brakes.
+    </li>
+    <li><strong>Do&#8230; empty your trunk of any heavy junk.</strong> Overloading your vehicle with things you don&#8217;t need &#8212; such as that heavy portable grill &#8212; can greatly impact brake life due to the extra weight you&#8217;re adding to your vehicle. Take stock of what&#8217;s in your trunk. Remove what you don&#8217;t need. This should improve your stopping power and eliminate the added stress and weight you&#8217;re placing on your rotors and other braking parts.
+    </li>
+</ul>
+<h3>Can you tell me the life expectancy of the rotors, brakes, pads, calipers, etc. you install&#63;</h3>
+<p>Life expectancy is universal in all walks of life. Just as health and habits can affect the length of your own life, driving habits will determine the life expectancy of your brake parts.</p>
+<ul>
+    <li><strong>The hard parts are built for endurance&#58;</strong> Rotors and calipers can last for years if you follow the recommended maintenance. But beware&#58; letting your brake pads wear down completely will only damage your rotors more quickly and lead to more expensive repairs.
+    </li>
+    <li><strong>Time is on your side.</strong> Calipers are usually designed for the long haul, but their biggest enemies are heat and corrosion. Improper maintenance can create caliper corrosion and leaks caused by constant stop and go, worn pads and metal on metal grinding. Road salt and weather can lead to corrosion as well. So schedule an annual brake inspection, and we&#8217;ll provide a clearer picture on their current condition. See your vehicle&#8217;s owner&#8217;s manual for recommended maintenance.
+    </li>
+    <li><strong>It&#8217;s all a balancing act.</strong> If your suspension system&#8217;s shocks and struts are off balance, you&#8217;ve probably noticed a significant shift in your ride&#8217;s weight distribution. You&#8217;ll be able to gauge this if you can feel the front end nose dive after you brake. The distance it takes to stop is also longer, causing your front brakes to wear out faster.
+    </li>
+    <li><strong>The Pulling Effect&#58;</strong> If your car pulls to the left or right when applying your brakes, this may indicate your brakes or suspension are functioning poorly and are in need of inspection.
+    </li>
+</ul>
+<p>Experiencing any of these braking symptoms&#63; We have the cure. <a href="/appointment/">Find your brake hero</a>.</p>]]>

+        <h2>Technicians &#38; Process</h2>
+        <h3>How do Firestone Complete Auto Care technicians inspect brakes&#63;</h3>
+<p>Our Free Brake Inspection is as thorough as the day is long. Just ask for it and you shall receive. Our techs can detect most any brake problem, big or small, by inspecting your ride&#8217;s different brake components. We have over 5,000 ASE certified brake technicians, the most in the auto repair industry. This ensures you have a knowledgeable and professional brake technician working on your vehicle.</p>
+<h3>What specialty training do your expert brake technicians undergo&#63; What is ASE Certification&#63;</h3>
+<p>You wouldn&#8217;t see a doctor who&#8217;s not an M.D., so we believe the same discretion applies to the person who repairs your brakes. To become a brake expert requires expert training and the drive to excel in auto care. Here at Firestone Complete Auto Care, we employ over 5,000 <abbr title="Auto Service Excellence">ASE</abbr> (Auto Service Excellence) certified technicians, the most in the industry. ASE is the automotive industry standard with a trusted certification process. For us, ASE is our way of ensuring that qualified and knowledgeable expert technicians are working on your automobile.</p>
+<h3>What do your ASE certified brake techs have to do to become brake specialist certified&#63;</h3>
+<p>Before any brake technician can even become ASE brake certified, they&#8217;re required to have two years of automotive experience.</p>
+<p>The Brake Specialist exam is one of over 50 different exams ASE offers. It is a rigorous test and the standard way to accurately measure the competency and knowledge of the technician seeking certification. </p>
+<p>Now the next time you see the ASE patch on one of our tech&#8217;s uniform, you&#8217;ll know you have a qualified person at the helm. Certification is not for life. To remain certified, ASE brake specialists must be retested every five years.</p>
+<p><a href="http://www.ase.com/" rel="external nofollow">Learn more at about ASE Certification</a></p>
+<h3>What is MAP&#63;</h3>
+<p><abbr title="Motorist Assurance Program">MAP</abbr> stands for the Motorist Assurance Program. It&#8217;s the consumer outreach program enacted by the Automotive Maintenance and Repair Association, Inc. &#40;AMRA&#41; and is a nationally recognized quality assurance program with participation by the industry&#8217;s leading retailers, suppliers, independent repair facilities, and vehicle manufacturers.</p>
+<p>To strengthen the relationship between consumers and auto repair facilities, MAP was started in 1994 to ensure the consumer always receives honest and detailed information regarding their vehicle parts&#59; all in the name of helping the consumer educate themselves on their vehicle while providing the most trusted and consistent recommendations about each vehicle part we&#8217;ve inspected.</p>
+<p>We&#8217;ve been a strong advocate of quality service. MAP is our way of ensuring to you that your car is in good hands at any and all Firestone Complete Auto Care stores. MAP is always being updated with the help of government and state officials to address new developments in the automotive industry.</p>
+<h3>What do the Red, Yellow and Green color codes mean on the inspection form&#63;</h3>
+<p>Understanding the color code is as easy as understanding every driver&#8217;s favorite frienemy, the traffic light. But first, to give you a little clarification, the color code system was enacted in 1994 by the Motorist Assurance Program &#40;MAP&#41; to create consistent standards for recommending and selling parts and services to consumers. We not only follow industry standards at Firestone Complete Auto Care, we also abide by our own quality standards.</p>
+<p>Using the traffic light model, we can precisely classify the wear on your parts&#58;</p>
+<ul>
+    <li><strong>Red&#58;</strong> A red mark on a particular part requires repair or replacement. If the part needs adjustment, such as relating to an alignment issue, this means we can repair the issue. Most of the time however, red means the part is no longer performing its intended purpose or it no longer meets the design specs. In both instances, you will be told the part needs to be replaced in order for your car to operate under mandated vehicle specifications. If a part is missing, a red mark will also be used to indicate replacement needed.
+    </li>
+    <li><strong>Yellow&#58;</strong> Though your vehicle can function with the particular part&#40;s&#41; in the yellow zone, we typically suggest repair or replacement to avoid the red zone scenario. Some yellow lights you can make it through, others turn red before you know it. A yellow mark could mean the part is close to the end of useful life. We refer to the manufacturer&#8217;s recommended action based on your vehicle&#8217;s original equipment manufacturer specifications. Your technician will also provide a recommendation based on their experience and knowledge of the part in question on your particular vehicle.
+    </li>
+    <li><strong>Green&#58;</strong> Everybody&#8217;s favorite color upon approaching any intersection. It&#8217;s also our favorite color to check off in relation to your car parts. If you receive this mark, give yourself a pat on the back, and rest easy knowing the checked parts passed our inspection and you&#8217;re good to go.

+<![CDATA[<p>Knowledge is power when it comes to your car&#8217;s battery and electrical system. In fact, it&#8217;s your ride&#8217;s heart and soul. The last thing you want is to be left stranded with a dead battery. The more you know about your battery and electrical system, the less likely you&#8217;ll get stuck. At Firestone Complete Auto Care, we&#8217;re here to help you understand just what&#8217;s going on with your vehicle&#8217;s battery and electrical system.</p>
+<p>On average, a battery will last 3 to 5 years, but driving habits and exposure to extreme elements can shorten the life of your car battery. At Firestone Complete Auto Care, we offer a free battery check&#45;up with every visit to our store. This is a quick diagnostic check to estimate the temperature at which your battery may fail. It also gives you some idea how much battery life you have left. One little test tells you if your battery is good to go.</p>
+        <h2>Battery Knowledge</h2>
+        <h3>How exactly does a car battery work&#63;</h3>
+<p>The car battery provides the jolt of electricity necessary to power all the electrical components in your vehicle. Talk about a pretty huge responsibility. Without battery power, your car, as you&#8217;ve probably noticed, won&#8217;t start.</p>
+<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at how that powerful little box works&#58;</p>
+<ul>
+    <li>A chemical reaction puts your car in action&#58; Your battery converts chemical energy into the electrical energy necessary to power your car, delivering voltage to the starter.</li>
+    <li>Keep the electric current steady&#58; Not only does your battery provide the energy required to start your car, it&#8217;s also stabilizing the voltage &#40;that&#8217;s the term for the energy supply&#41; in order to keep your engine running. A lot&#8217;s riding on the battery. Call it the &#8216;little box that could.&#8217;</li>
+</ul>
+<p>The car battery may be small, but the power it provides is huge. Test your battery now with our <a href="/auto-services/batteries/virtual-battery-tester">Virtual Battery Tester</a>.</p>
+<p><a href="/auto-services/batteries/">Find the right Interstate Battery</a> for your specific vehicle, at the right price &#8212; right now.</p>
+<h3>How do Interstate batteries compare to other car battery brands&#63;</h3>
+<p>We stock these quality brand batteries &#8212; and install them too.</p>
+<ul>
+    <li>Manufactured by Johnson Controls&#58; the world leader in battery quality with 80&#43; years of innovation.</li>
+    <li>Interstate is &#35;1&#58; Interstate Batteries are the &#35;1 automotive replacement batteries in America with 15 million batteries sold every year &#8211; the quality and reliability is in the numbers.</li>
+</ul>
+    <h2>Symptoms &#38; Procedures</h2>
+    <h3>Are there any warning signs that may indicate my battery is on the fritz&#63;</h3>
+<p>&#8220;If I only knew sooner.&#8221; We&#8217;ve all been there before. Fortunately, there are various indications and symptoms that your battery may need replacement&#58;</p>
+<ol>
+    <li>Slow engine crank&#58; When you attempt to start the vehicle, the cranking of the engine is sluggish and takes longer than normal to start. You&#8217;d best describe it as the &quot;rur rur rur&quot; starting noise sound.</li>
+    <li>Check engine light&#58; The check engine light sometimes appears when your battery power is weak. Strange system indicator lights&#8211;such as check engine and low coolant lights&#8211;could mean there&#8217;s a problem with your battery. &#40;It could also just mean you need more coolant&#41;.</li>
+    <li>
+    Low battery fluid level&#58; Car batteries typically have a part of the casing that&#8217;s translucent so you can always keep an eye on your battery&#8217;s fluid level. You can also inspect it by removing the red and black caps if they are not sealed &#40;most modern car batteries now permanently seal these parts&#41;.
+    <ul>
+            <li>Bottom line&#58; If the fluid level is below the lead plates &#40;energy conductor&#41; inside, it&#8217;s time to have the battery and charging system tested. When fluid levels drop, it&#8217;s typically caused by overcharging &#40;heat&#41;.</li>
+    </ul>
+    </li>
+    <li>The swelling, bloating battery case&#58; If your battery casing looks like it ate a very large meal, this could indicate a battery gone bad. You can blame excessive heat for causing your battery case to swell, decreasing your battery life.</li>
+    <li>Eww, there&#8217;s a stinky, rotten egg smell&#58; You may notice a pungent, rotten egg smell &#40;sulfur odor&#41; around the battery. The cause&#58; Battery leaks. Leaking also causes the corrosion around the posts &#40;where the &#43; and &#8211; cable connections are located.&#41; The gunk may need to be removed or your car may not start.</li>
+    <li>Three years &#43; battery age is considered an old timer&#58; Your battery can last well beyond three years but, at the very least, have its current condition inspected on a yearly basis when it reaches the three year mark. Battery life cycles range from three&#45;to&#45;five years depending on the battery. However, driving habits, weather and frequent short trips &#40;under 20 minutes&#41; can drastically shorten the actual life of your car battery.</li>
+</ol>
+<h3>How do I determine if my battery is too old&#63;</h3>
+<p>For one thing, you can check the four&#45; or five&#45;digit date code on the cover of your battery case. The first part of the code is key&#58; look for the letter and digit. A letter is assigned to each month &#8212; you know, like A for January, B for February and so on. The number that follows nods to the year, as in 9 for 2009 and 1 for 2011. This code tells you when the battery was shipped from the factory to our local Interstate Battery wholesale distributor. The additional digits tell where the battery was made. Car batteries last, on average, three&#45; to&#45;five years. Mind you, there are also weak battery signs to watch for, like a slow engine crank of low fluid level. If your battery case is swollen or bloated, there&#8217;s a smelly rotten egg scent coming from the battery or your check engine light appears, trouble may be beyond the bend. And if it&#8217;s over three years old? Consider it time for close monitoring. That&#8217;s what we&#8217;re here for.</p>

+</ul>
+    <h2>Electrical Systems</h2>
+    <h3>Can a bad battery harm the charging system or starter&#63;</h3>
+<p>You bet. If you have a weak ankle, you tend to overcompensate and put more weight&#8211;and stress&#8211;on the healthy ankle. Same concept with a weak battery. When you have a weak battery, your car ends up putting additional stress on healthy parts. The charging system, starter motor or starter solenoid can be affected.</p>
+<p>These parts can malfunction because they&#8217;re drawing excessive voltage to compensate for the lack of battery power. Leave this problem unresolved, and you could wind up replacing expensive electrical parts&#8211;typically without warning.</p>
+<p><strong>Quick Tip&#58;</strong> Our Electrical System Check makes sure all the necessary parts are drawing the correct voltage. We&#8217;ll know right away if there&#8217;s any weak parts that may need immediate replacement. Don&#8217;t leave your car&#8217;s power to chance, you may end up paying for it later.</p>
+<h3>How do you know if your alternator isn&#8217;t giving your battery enough electricity&#63;</h3>      
+<p>Let&#8217;s just say we&#8217;re clairvoyant.</p>
+<p>All joking aside, let&#8217;s start with the obvious symptoms&#58;</p>
+<ul>
+    <li>The electrical system is possessed. Strange flickering lights or warning lights such as &#8217;Check Engine&#8217; flicker, disappear, and then reappear again. All these malfunctions usually start occurring when the car battery is nearly drained and struggling to provide power. If the alternator is faulty, your battery will no longer receive a charge and is moments away from being totally kaput.</li>
+    <li>The Slow Crank. You&#8217;re starting your car, and it keeps turning and turning, eventually starting&#8211;or not. This could mean your alternator isn&#8217;t charging your battery properly. If you start experiencing the possessed electrical system as well, please stop in to the nearest service facility. Your car could be moments away from a dead battery and alternator.</li>
+</ul>
+<p><strong>Let&#8217;s review&#58;</strong> All the above happens when the battery is not receiving a charge &#40;due to a faulty alternator&#41;. Your battery will continue to drain. When it drains completely&#8230;well, we all know what happens next&#58; curbed car. And neither you, nor us, want you to go through that.</p>
+<p><strong>Quick tip&#58;</strong> The sooner we can inspect your vehicle, the less likely you&#8217;ll face every drivers&#8217; biggest fear&#8211;a car that won&#8217;t start. Drive with peace of mind.</p>

+<h2>The jolt your ride needs to ride on.</h2>
+<p>Powering your ride is a complex affair. But here&#8217;s a straightforward fact&#58; you need a functioning battery to make it go. After all, without battery power, your car won&#8217;t start. Your car battery provides the zap of electricity needed to put electrical components to work. It also converts chemical energy into the electrical energy that powers your car and delivers voltage to its starter. And it stabilizes the voltage &#40;a.k.a. energy supply&#41; that keeps your engine running. Important, indeed.</p>

+<![CDATA[<h2>Quick Tips&#58; Maintenance</h2>
+<ol class="reduced">
+ <li>
+  <h3>Tip 01</h3>
+  <p>
+   <strong>Backup power and connectors&#58;</strong><br />
+   Lights off &#47; accessories unplugged. All it takes is one light left on overnight or accessories plugged in while your car is off and guess what&#63; Your battery is dead before you know it. If it&#8217;s too late, make sure you have jumper cables on hand, or better yet, a self&#45;powering car battery jumper in your trunk.
+  </p>
+ </li>
+ <li>
+  <h3>Tip 02</h3>
+  <p>
+   <strong>Conserve energy&#58;</strong><br />
+   &#8220;Just say no&#8221; to short trip after short trip. Your battery requires time to charge. If you take frequent short trips, this can result in inconstistent charge levels and&#47;or a drained battery.
+  </p>
+ </li>
+ <li>
+  <h3>Tip 03</h3>
+  <p>
+   <strong>Professional maintenance&#58;</strong><br />
+   Failure is not an option. Always have a qualified professional inspecting your electrical systems. We offer a full electrical system check and have certified <abbr title="National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence">ASE</abbr> technicians on staff.
+  </p>
+ </li>
+ <li>
+  <h3>Tip 04</h3>
+  <p>
+   <strong>Keep it cool&#58;</strong><br />
+   Parking in cooler locations &#40;covered garages&#41; in hotter climates can help, but your best bet is to have your battery tested, at the very least, before summer. Prepare for the worst and you may just avoid it altogether. That&#8217;s a win&#45;win situation there.
+  </p>
+ </li>
+ <li>
+  <h3>Tip 05</h3>
+  <p>
+   <strong>Clean it up&#58;</strong><br />
+   Make sure your vehicle&#8217;s battery terminals are kept clean and free of corrosion.
+  </p>
+ </li>
+ <li>
+  <h3>Tip 06</h3>
+  <p>
+   <strong>Timely up&#45;keep&#58;</strong><br />
+   Always have a qualified professional maintain your electrical system and make sure to have quality replacement parts installed when existing electrical system parts fail.
+  </p>
+ </li>
+</ol>
+<h2>Quick Tips&#58; Jumping a Battery</h2>
+<ol class="reduced">
+ <li>
+  <h3>Tip 01</h3>
+  <p>Never connect the black cable to the negative &#40;&#8211;&#41; terminal on your dead battery. This is very dangerous, as it could result in an explosion.</p>
+ </li>
+ <li>
+  <h3>Tip 02</h3>
+  <p>Make sure you follow the instructions in your owner&#8217;s manual when jump starting your vehicle. Every car is different. Trust us. We&#8217;re experts.</p>
+ </li>
+</ol>
+<p><strong>Warning&#58;</strong> Do not, under any circumstance, attempt to connect loose wires. Unless you are a certified technician, leave the dangerous stuff to us. If you mishandle the wiring, it&#8217;s very easy to short out expensive computer components and put yourself in harm&#8217;s way.</p>
+<h2>Top Questions and Answers.</h2>
+<h3>How do I jump start a battery&#63;</h3>
+<p>Believe it or not, today&#8217;s vehicles have various methods for jump starting car batteries. It&#8217;s no longer just a simple &#8220;connect this cable here and that one there&#8221; scenario.</p>
+<p>Please refer to your owner&#8217;s manual for instructions relating to jump starting your specific vehicle. Many vehicles have crucial steps that must be followed precisely so you can protect your electrical system and have a successful jump.</p>
+<p>If you&#8217;re still experiencing issues with your battery, stop in to any of <a href="/appointment/">our locations</a> for a battery test, and we&#8217;ll get your car back up and running in no time.</p>
+<h3>Why can&#8217;t you connect the black jumper cable to the dead battery&#8217;s negative &#40;&#8211;&#41; terminal&#63;</h3>
+<p>Oh, you know, to avoid explosions and what not. Bet you didn&#8217;t think a dead battery could create that, huh&#63;</p>
+<p>Typically, when a person jump starts a car, sparks can occur. That&#8217;s why it is recommended that you connect the negative jumper cable to the vehicle body and not the negative post of the battery. This is so you can avoid sparks from occurring near the battery where flammable hydrogen gas may be present, resulting in a possible explosion.</p>
+<h4>Quick Tip&#58;</h4>
+<ul>
+ <li>Never connect the black cable to the negative &#40;&#8211;&#41; terminal on your dead battery. This is very dangerous, could result in a possible explosion.</li>
+ <li>Make sure you follow the instructions in your owner&#8217;s manual when jump starting your vehicle. Every car is different. Trust us. We&#8217;re experts.</li>

+<content>
+<![CDATA[<p>Your car&#8217;s electrical system consists of the battery, starter and alternator. The battery provides juice to the starter. Then, the alternator gives that battery the energy it needs to power your car. If one of these parts is not working properly, your car won&#8217;t start or run correctly. Our expert technicians can perform an electrical system check to ensure everything is working properly. It pinpoints any problems that may occur with your electrical system. If our technicians find a problem, they&#8217;ll let you know what they can do to fix it. We can curb any problem before it starts, so you won&#8217;t be left stranded with a non&#45;starting vehicle.</p>
+<h2>Battery</h2>
+<p>Until your vehicle starts, your battery is providing the car&#8217;s entire electrical current. This includes the current to the ignition and fuel systems, which are responsible for creating the combustion necessary for your engine to function.</p>
+<h2>Starter</h2>
+<p>While the battery supplies the power to start your vehicle, the starter is really what gets the engine going. The battery supplies a small amount of power to the starter motor. The starter then rotates the flywheel, which turns the crankshaft and begins the movement of the engine&#8217;s pistons. This intricate process is why it&#8217;s key to make sure the starter works.</p>
+<p>It&#8217;s difficult to determine when a starter will fail exactly, but an electrical system check at Firestone Complete Auto Care can help recognize the warning signs. We check if the starter is drawing the proper amount of current. An excessive current draw will indicate a worn starter, while a low current draw points to corroded cables or connections. Not to worry&#33; This is a problem our expert technicians can fix.</p>
+<h2>Alternator</h2>
+<p>When your engine is running, the alternator keeps the battery charged and the electrical system going. Your car can start with a faulty alternator, but it won&#8217;t be able to run for an extended period of time. If the alternator requires replacement, your vehicle&#8217;s electrical system will perform erratically, its battery will discharge, and eventually your engine will lose power. A complete electrical system check from Firestone Complete Auto Care will tell you whether the alternator is generating the proper amount of current and voltage. That way, you have a heads up before your alternator fails.</p>
+<h2>See It in Action</h2>
+<p>So you turn the key and your vehicle&#8217;s electrical system goes into action. The battery provides juice to the starter, the starter turns and the alternator gives the battery the energy it needs to power your lights, defroster, wipers and accessories. See how it works&#58;</p>
+<figure class="figure-electrical-system">

+</figure>
+<h2>A healthy electrical system. For a reliable ride.</h2>
+<p>Your car&#8217;s electrical system is important. Really important. So is staying informed about its ability to perform. Left unchecked, a weak or dead battery can wreak havoc on other electrical system parts, like alternators and starters. If your electrical system is showing signs of acting up &#40;<a href="/cf/batteries/car-battery-problems-when-is-it-time-for-a-new-battery/">see symptoms here</a>&#41;, don&#8217;t delay. Bring your car to your local Firestone Complete Auto Care so they can assess the situation, make sure voltage is correct and prevent further potential damage. You don&#8217;t want failure be an option, ever.</p>

+    <h2>Top Questions and Answers.</h2>
+    <h3>How could a battery drain overnight&#63;</h3>
+<p>Batteries can do a lot of things while we&#8217;re not looking. The most common way a battery will drain overnight is by leaving a light on or a power adapter plugged in, zapping all your battery power while you&#8217;re fast asleep.</p>
+<p>Your battery can also drain overnight if there are faulty electrical components or wiring. If this might be the case, let us check it out so we can resolve the problem and get you rolling again.</p>

+<h3>What factors will affect the life of my car battery&#63;</h3>
+<p>So, you want to know if your battery will last three years or, better yet, five years, eh&#63; Well, that all depends on your driving habits, plus the year&#45;round climate in your area.</p>
+<ol>
+    <li>Short Trips. Shorter battery life. If you take many short trips &#40;less than 20 minutes&#41;, your battery won&#8217;t have enough time to fully recharge, shortening its overall life expectancy.</li>
+    <li>Extreme temperatures kill batteries. The dog days of summer take the biggest toll on your battery. Scorching temperatures &#8212; and even freezing temperatures &#8212; can shorten battery life. A lot of times, waiting until the deep freeze of winter to replace your battery is often too late. The cold weather could pretty much make that heat worn battery dead on arrival.</li>
+    <li>Find your region. Discover the average battery life.</li>

+<h3>What are the warning signs that my alternator is failing&#63;</h3>
+<p>&#8220;If I only knew sooner&#8221;. We&#8217;ve all been there before. Fortunately, there are various indications and symptoms that your battery may need replacement&#58;</p>
+<ol>
+    <li>Slow engine crank&#58; When you attempt to start the vehicle, the cranking of the engine is sluggish and takes longer than normal to start. You&#8217;d best describe it as the &#8220;rur rur rur&#8221; starting noise sound.</li>
+    <li>Check engine light&#58; The check engine light sometimes appears when your battery power is weak. Strange system indicator lights &#8211; such as check engine and low coolant lights &#8211; could mean there&#8217;s a problem with your battery. &#40;It could also just mean you need more coolant&#41;.</li>
+    <li>
+    Low battery fluid level&#58; Car batteries typically have a part of the casing that&#8217;s translucent so you can always keep an eye on your battery&#8217;s fluid level. You can also inspect it by removing the red and black caps if they are not sealed &#40;most modern car batteries now permanently seal these parts&#41;.
+    <ul>
+            <li>Bottom line&#58; If the fluid level is below the lead plates &#40;energy conductor&#41; inside, it&#8217;s time to have the battery and charging system tested. When fluid levels drop, it&#8217;s typically caused by overcharging &#40;heat&#41;.</li>
+    </ul>
+    </li>
+    <li>The swelling, bloating battery case&#58; If your battery casing looks like it ate a very large meal, this could indicate a battery gone bad. You can blame excessive heat for causing your battery case to swell, decreasing your battery life.</li>
+    <li>Eww, there&#8217;s a stinky, rotten egg smell&#58; You may notice a pungent, rotten egg smell &#40;sulfur odor&#58;&#41; around the battery. The cause&#58; Battery leaks. Leaking also causes the corrosion around the posts &#40;where the &#40;&#43;&#41; and &#40;&#8211;&#41; cable connections are located.&#41; The gunk may need to be removed; otherwise, your car may not start.</li>
+    <li>Three years &#43; battery age is considered an old timer&#58; Your battery can last well beyond three years but, at the very least, have its current condition inspected on a yearly basis when it reaches the three year mark. Battery life cycles range from three&#45;to&#45;five years depending on the battery. However, driving habits, weather and frequent short trips &#40;under 20 minutes&#41; can drastically shorten the actual life of your car battery.</li>

+<![CDATA[<h2>How Your Battery Works</h2>
+<p>Your vehicle&#8217;s battery is considered the heart of its electrical system. Your battery converts chemical energy into electrical energy to make your car run. Not only does your battery provide energy to start your car, it also helps stabilize voltage to keep your engine running. When your battery is low on juice or its cables or terminals are loose, your car won&#8217;t start. Unfortunately, your vehicle doesn&#8217;t always give you warning signs that your battery is about to die. However, there are some ways to keep your battery running newer, longer.</p>
+<ul>
+    <li>Avoid leaving on lights and accessories when the engine is not running &#8212; this will drain your battery.</li>
+    <li>Take fewer short trips to prevent inconsistent battery charge levels.</li>
+    <li>Make sure your vehicle&#8217;s battery terminals are kept clean and free of corrosion.</li>
+    <li>Always have a qualified professional maintain your electrical systems.</li>
+    <li>Have quality replacement parts installed when existing electrical system parts fail.</li>
+</ul>
+<p>The last thing you need is for your battery to unexpectedly fail. We&#8217;ll check it before that happens, so you don&#8217;t get stuck. Our techs can give your battery a free check&#45;up the next time you bring your vehicle in for maintenance, tires or other repairs. This quick test lets you know if your battery is providing adequate power and at what temperature it could potentially fail.</p>
+<p>When your engine is running, the alternator keeps the battery charged and the electrical system going. Your car can start with a faulty alternator, but it won&#8217;t be able to run for an extended period of time. If the alternator requires replacement, your vehicle&#8217;s electrical system will perform erratically, its battery will discharge, and eventually your engine will lose power. A complete electrical system check from Firestone Complete Auto Care will tell you whether the alternator is generating the proper amount of current and voltage, to let you know before your alternator fails.</p>
+<img src="/static-fcac/images/cf/articles/battery-life-expectancy-zone.jpg" class="right" alt="Battery Life Expectancy Zone" />
+<h2>A Battery&#8217;s Life is Influenced by Your Climate</h2>
+<p>This map gives an indication of how long a car battery should last in different climates. Use the image to determine how long your battery should generally last. Other factors affect battery quality as well; for instance, driving less than 20 minutes doesn&#8217;t give your battery a chance to recharge. Driving habits, extreme temperatures and bad maintenance techniques can quickly drain your battery&#8217;s charge. This makes it more difficult to determine how long a battery will last, and all factors must be considered.</p>
+<p>Try our <a href="/auto-services/batteries/virtual-battery-tester">Virtual Battery Tester</a> to get an idea of how long your original equipment battery might last. If your battery is near the end of its estimated life, Firestone Complete Auto Care offers a variety of Interstate Batteries to fit your vehicle.</p>
+<h2>Car Battery Clarity. Never a Mystery.</h2>
+<p>Some things in life leave you stumped. But there&#8217;s no reason your car battery has to be one of them. Check out our frequently asked questions and become a battery buff. Of course, Firestone Complete Auto Care technicians can help as well &#8212; they know what to do when yours is on its last leg.

+<![CDATA[
+        <h2>Alignment Basics</h2>
+        <h3>Why is a wheel alignment so important&#63;</h3>
+<p>Picture yourself cruising down the most beautiful road in the world. Now imagine driving down that same road with your wheels pointing the wrong way. Not the most beautiful road in the world anymore.</p>
+<p>Alignment is a really complex topic covering a variety of terms and a smorgasbord of parts. When your wheels are out of alignment, your tires aren&#8217;t pointing in the right direction. This will affect your steering and suspension, but more importantly, it could affect your safety and the durability of your tires and all the parts controlling them.</p>
+<p>Firestone Complete Auto Care has all the <a href="/repair/alignment.jsp">services for your alignment needs</a>.</p>
+<p>Ready for your perfect alignment&#63; <a href="/appointment/">So are we</a>.</p>
+<h3>How do vehicles lose their wheel alignment&#63;</h3>
+<p>It doesn&#8217;t take much, that&#8217;s for sure. There are many ways for your car to lose its alignment. You&#8217;ll be familiar with most of the causes, but what you probably didn&#8217;t think was that each one could do quite a number on your vehicle&#8217;s alignment. </p>
+<p>Wheel alignment can be thrown off by&#58;</p>
+<ul>
+    <li>Pot holes</li>
+    <li>Hitting the curb</li>
+    <li>Bumping into concrete parking stalls</li>
+    <li>Fair wear and tear &#8212; as vehicles age, rubber components start cracking or lose their elasticity and ball and socket joints develop looseness. They start to give a little more, progressively getting slightly worse over time.</li>
+</ul>
+<p>Alignment angles are measured in tenths and hundredths of degrees or inches. Over time, a slight misalignment can cause a lot of uneven or premature tire wear. Put your next alignment in the hands of an alignment pro. <a href="/appointment/">Call us today</a>.</p>
+<h3>What happens if I don&#8217;t get my wheels aligned&#63;</h3>
+<p>We cringe just thinking of someone never having an alignment performed on his or her vehicle. What will ultimately end up happening is you&#8217;ll throw a lot of money down the drain on tires because, with out proper alignment, tires wear down a lot faster. Simple as that. And you&#8217;ll most likely notice something&#8217;s wrong while you&#8217;re driving; your vehicle will probably not handle as well as it should and, in the most extreme cases, you could have a pretty difficult time maintaining control of your ride altogether. All this bad news is, fortunately for you, easily preventable by having your wheels aligned when needed.</p>
+<p><strong>Did you know&#63;</strong> The smartest move is to have your alignment checked every other oil change. Doing so will make your tires last longer.</p>
+<p><strong>Quick Tip&#58;</strong> If your vehicle needs an alignment, ask for a Lifetime Alignment. With this service we&#8217;ll align your tires every 6,000 miles or when requested for as long as you own your ride.</p>
+<h3>How often should I have my alignment checked&#63;</h3>
+<p>Long live longer tire life. We recommend an Alignment Check with every other oil change. A lot happens over the course of 6,000 miles. You drive through pot holes, travel down gravely stretches of road, or worse, knock your wheels on the curb while making a turn. All these things can impact the way your tires sit, throwing off alignment in an instant. </p>
+<p><strong>Did you know&#63;</strong> The longer you wait for an alignment, the more damage that can occur. You&#8217;d be surprised. If it&#8217;s been awhile since your last alignment, it&#8217;s time for a checkup.</p>
+<h3>Do vehicles have different types of alignment specifications&#63;</h3>
+<p>Every model that rolls off the assembly line has unique alignment specifications. Alignment specs are determined by the vehicle manufacturer for each make and model. The size, length, weight and intended use of the vehicle all play a role in the determining the correct alignment angles.</p>
+<p><strong>Did you know&#63;</strong> We use a special computerized alignment machine pre&#45;loaded with every vehicle&#8217;s alignment specifications. Once the vehicle type is determined, the high tech and precise measuring begins. Upon completion, you&#8217;ll receive a print out displaying the vehicle manufacturer&#8217;s alignment angle specifications, what your angles are before adjustments were made and where it stands after adjustments are made. At Firestone Complete Auto Care, we provide alignments for most any vehicle using this special equipment.</p>
+<h3>Why is it so hard to determine if my car&#8217;s alignment is off&#63;</h3>
+<p>It&#8217;s not you, it&#8217;s your eyes. We mere humans can&#8217;t see in fractions of degrees without technology. It only takes a minuscule amount of misalignment to have a huge impact on tire life. So, signs and symptoms of poor wheel alignment, unfortunately, aren&#8217;t always right there staring you in face.</p>
+<h3>How are alignments different today&#63;</h3>
+<p>Alignments aren&#8217;t different per se, but vehicles are more advanced and precise now than ever before. And at today&#8217;s prices we expect more from our rides, that&#8217;s for sure. Let&#8217;s just say a lot has changed since dad was driving that Oldsmobile. As a result, maintaining the ride and performance that modern vehicles are capable of, a proper alignment must take into account where the rear wheels are pointed.</p>
+<p>There&#8217;s more vehicle variety on the road these days, too. Vehicles have different purposes. Some have rear steering capabilities. Some have stability controls or dynamic stability controls or active stability management or SAS &#40;Steering Angle Sensors&#41;. Every car manufacturer is different and requires different methods to adjust each unique system.</p>

+    <h2>Symptoms &#38; Solutions</h2>
+    <h3>How do driving conditions affect my vehicle&#8217;s wheel alignment&#63;</h3>
+<p>Bad roads can be your wheels&#8217; worst enemy. If you drive down poorly maintained roads, drive through pot holes, or even hit a curb, your alignment can be greatly affected.</p>
+<p>This can cause even the slightest, tiniest alignment issue, which can accelerate uneven tire wear. Make sure you have your alignment checked every 6,000 miles or so. Your tires and your wallet will thank you later.</p>
+<p>Have alignment questions&#63; Need to schedule an Alignment Check&#63; <a href="/appointment/">Call us</a>.</p>
+<h3>How will a wheel alignment help my vehicle&#63;</h3>
+<p><strong>Repeat after us&#58; A wheel alignment ensures optimal drivability</strong>. It will help your tires last longer, your vehicle drive smoother, ultimately keeping your wheels pointed in the right direction. And, when it drives more smoothly, it&#8217;s smooth sailing &#8212; or should we say cruising &#8212; ahead. Plus, your car will require less energy to keep going, potentially saving a ton of fuel depending on how much alignment was required.</p>
+<p>When your car rolled off the manufacturer assembly line, it came preset with special angles that position your tires correctly. And for good reason.  In order for your vehicle to travel the way it&#8217;s supposed to, it will need precise alignment. Mis&#45;alignment can lead to uneven tire wear, poor handling and shorter tire life. Tires are expensive. Keeping them aligned isn&#8217;t.</p>

+<h3>Are there any warning lights that indicate an alignment problem&#63;</h3>
+<p>Nope. Sorry. Regular checkups are a good defense though.</p>
+<h3>What does tire wear mean to my car&#8217;s alignment&#63;</h3>
+<p>The name of the poor alignment game is uneven tire wear. Ideally, tires should wear evenly across the tread. If you&#8217;re noticing excessive wear on the rear inside tires, you may have too much junk in the trunk or need an alignment adjustment. Uneven tire wear can also result in less MPGs and more pain at the gas pump.</p>
+<p><strong>Quick Fact&#58;</strong> Poor alignment can shorten a tire&#8217;s life by thousands of miles and compromise very crucial steering and suspension parts. That&#8217;s a big hit to the wallet. If you don&#8217;t want to replace tires as often and enjoy the benefits of better fuel economy, have your alignment checked, at the very least, with every other oil change or at the first sign of uneven or premature tire wear.</p>
+<h3>How can I tell if my car&#8217;s alignment is off&#63;</h3>
+<p>There are some noticeable signs that could indicate a misalignment. Just use your eyes, ears and hands. Your senses &#40;and even the good old personal hunch&#41; are good human capital for spotting poor alignment. Here are some common signs that you are dealing with wheels with poor alignment&#58;</p>
+<ul>
+    <li>Vehicle pulling to the left or right</li>
+    <li>Uneven or rapid tire wear</li>
+    <li>Your steering wheel is crooked when driving straight</li>
+    <li>Squealing tires</li>
+</ul>
+<p>Noticing any of these alignment issues&#63; Let&#8217;s get your ride pointing in the right direction again. <a href="/appointment/">Schedule an Alignment Check</a>.</p>
+<p><strong>Quick Tip&#58;</strong> If you are unsure about your current alignment, please give us a call. Tire misalignment can be so subtle, you may not even realize it. Luckily for your wheels, we have the precision equipment and expertise to check your alignment and fix it if needed.</p>
+<h3>What are some misalignment issues I can remedy myself&#63;</h3>
+<p>Looks like we&#8217;ve got an avid problem solver in the house. Well, let&#8217;s put your skills to work and do some solving. Even if everything feels right, and no symptoms are present, there are some more alignment issues that you can remedy yourself.</p>
+<p>Try these out&#58;</p>
+<ul>
+    <li>Remove junk from your trunk Alignment is based on tire angles, which go hand-in-hand with vehicle chassis height.  If you have too much weight loading down your back end, that lowers your vehicle height, throwing off your alignment. Remove what you don&#8217;t need, and make sure to have your alignment check since your alignment can&#8217;t adjust itself.</li>
+    <li>Maintain correct air pressure in your tires</li>
+    <li>Embrace conservative driving.  It will place less strain on steering and suspension components which are key to maintaining proper alignment.</li>

+    <h2>Our Expertise</h2>
+    <h3>What equipment do you use to calibrate my vehicle&#8217;s wheel alignment&#63;</h3>
+<p>No set of eyeballs has ever produced an accurate alignment. A successful tire alignment hinges on using advanced computerized alignment equipment. We&#8217;re talking fractions of a degree here. Undetectable to the naked eye.</p>
+<p>At Firestone Complete Auto Care, our advanced computerized alignment equipment configures to your vehicle&#8217;s camber, caster and toe specs.</p>
+<p>Our Computerized Alignment Equipment&#58;</p>
+<ul>
+    <li>Measures and sets all four tires to the settings specified by your vehicle manufacturer. Accuracy and precision of this equipment minimizes accelerated tire wear and reduced fuel economy.</li>
+    <li>Provides the most accurate reading available. Gone are the days of eyeballing wheel alignment and using tape measures and strings to set alignment angles. Our computerized alignment equipment gets the job done better and more accurately than ever before.</li>
+    <li>Knows every vehicle. Each vehicle has different specifications provided by the vehicle manufacturer. It&#8217;s all preloaded in our equipment so you get a precise alignment.</li>
+</ul>
+<p>Ready for the perfect alignment&#63; <a href="/appointment/">So are we</a>.</p>
+<p>Take advantage of our <a href="/repair/alignment.jsp">Lifetime Alignment</a> service.</p>
+                                                
+<h3>Do I need an appointment for wheel alignment&#63;</h3>
+<p>You don&#8217;t need one, but an appointment always helps. Wheel alignments aren&#8217;t an in&#45;and&#45;out service. They take precision and focus and the time needed will vary based on the current condition of your ride. If your alignment is off by even a tiny fraction of a degree, it can mean trouble for your vehicle.</p>
+<p>We&#8217;d be happy to set up a wheel alignment service time that fits your schedule and your vehicle&#8217;s needs. And, to top it all off, we&#8217;ll perform your alignment with accurate, state of the art computerized alignment equipment.</p>
+<p>Time for an Alignment Check&#63; Don&#8217;t know&#63; <a href="/appointment/">Schedule an appointment</a>.</p>
+
+<h3>How long does it take to perform an alignment&#63;</h3>
+<p>To quote the great Albert Einstein, &#8220;<q>It&#8217;s all relative.</q>&#8221; Every vehicle is different, with varying degrees of needs, making it difficult to offer a standard wait time.</p>
+<strong>There are many factors that determine how long it will take.</strong>
+<p>Wait times all depend on your vehicle type and its present condition And, with all the angles that come into play in today&#8217;s rides, each wheel could have a minimum of three alignment angles that need adjustment &#8212; caster, camber and toe. That&#8217;s potentially 12 adjustments total. That right there means an alignment is no in&#45;and&#45;out&#45;you&#45;go service. At least, if you want it done right.</p>
+<p><strong>Quick fact</strong>: If you live in the snow belt and rust has set in, even the simplest adjustments can take awhile. And, remember, misalignment of any steering or suspension angle could mean a lot of accelerated wear to your tires.</p>
+<p><a href="/appointment/">Schedule an Alignment Check</a> and get the best handling from your ride.</p>
+                                                
+<h3>Why do you only offer a thrust &#40;four&#45;wheel&#41; alignment&#63;</h3>
+<p>Vehicles are more advanced and precise than ever before. It&#8217;s only logical that we expect more from these newer, more expensive and complex vehicles. Maintaining the ride and performance demands all your wheels, not just the front wheels, are always working together, not against one another.</p>
+<p>For that to happen, modern vehicles must be properly aligned, and that now includes the back wheels &#40;thrust&#41;. Where the rear wheels are pointed will determine where the front wheels are pointed. A two wheel alignment is so last century, and with that, gone are the days of the two wheel alignment.</p>
+<p>In order to perform a proper alignment, it&#8217;s essential that we adjust the front wheels to compensate for any potential thrust angle from the back tires. It&#8217;s all about protecting your tires and preserving your ride from the damaging effects of poor alignment.</p>
+
+<h3>Why would my vehicle have to be altered to have an alignment performed&#63;</h3>
+<p>Believe it or not, some alignments are not adjustable. Some vehicles allow all 12 adjustments, but some are designed with fewer possible adjustments. In order to change non&#45;adjustable angles, off&#45;set bushings, bolts or shims may need to be installed. These modifications may vary by vehicle.</p>
+<strong>The good news&#58;</strong>
+<p>If your vehicle requires aftermarket parts to correct an out&#45;of&#45;spec alignment angle, we can do it. If there are worn parts that prevent accurately setting the alignment, we can replace them.</p>
+<h3>What wheel alignment services do you offer&#63;</h3>
+<p>We offer three alignment services to cover all your alignment needs. These are an Alignment Check, Standard Alignment and Lifetime Alignment.</p>
+<p>Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s included with each service:</p>

+     </li>
+</ol>
+<h3>What are your steering and suspension services&#63;</h3>
+<p>A Standard or Lifetime Alignment can&#8217;t always solve everything. Wouldn&#8217;t that be nice, though&#63; A part of your steering or suspension can be worn or even broken. There are a lot more parts than you think working to keep your car headed in the right direction. No matter what, we have the technicians and the parts to meet your car&#8217;s needs.</p>

+                                                
+<h3>Why does Firestone recommend other services when I just want an alignment&#63;</h3>
+<p>There&#8217;s a lot going on during a wheel alignment. Although we&#8217;ll line your tires up to the exact manufacturer specified angles, along the way, parts that ensure proper alignment can wear out and become a major issue for the drivability and continued alignment of your ride. </p>
+<p>Steering and suspension play a major role in keeping your alignment set, but if a part on your steering or suspension is worn out or broken, your alignment can&#8217;t be properly set without replacing the part.</p>

+<p>Get your tires back pointing in the right direction. <a href="/appointment/">Schedule an Alignment Check</a>.</p>
+<h3>Why don&#8217;t you offer a &#36;29.99 alignment&#63;</h3>
+<p>Ah, the ever popular, no frills alignment. Well for one, most inexpensive alignment deals don&#8217;t cover all four wheels. In the olden days, it was common to have only two tires aligned. But now, with vehicles being more precise and advanced then ever before, only aligning the front wheels is doing less than half the job.</p>
+<p><strong>Front and back tire alignment is a pretty big deal.</strong> It requires a lot of calculations. Cars today are more precise and advanced. Some have suspension and stability controls that are affected by mis&#45;alignment.  Since the front and back tires work together, they need to be aligned with each other. That&#8217;s why we use state of the art computerized alignment equipment and the trusted hands of certified techs to get the job done right.</p>
+<p><strong>Don&#8217;t buy the &#8217;half steak sandwich&#8217;</strong>&#8230; because that&#8217;s pretty much what a two wheel alignment will leave you with. Get the full alignment.  Take your car to us, and we&#8217;ll align your vehicle with state of the art computerized alignment equipment and certified techs. You paid good money for your vehicle and tires, keep your ride running longer with a complete and precise alignment.</p>
+<h3>How can I save on a wheel alignment&#63;</h3>
+<p>Sign your ride up for the Lifetime Alignment service. It&#8217;s in your car&#8217;s best interest. Look, if you plan on keeping your car for many miles to come, you&#8217;re going to need an alignment from time to time.  With all those pot holes and bumps and bounces here and there, it&#8217;s actually pretty easy for your vehicle to lose alignment.</p>
+<p><strong>To save on the expensive cost of having to replace tires or parts sooner</strong>, schedule an Alignment Check with every other oil change or every 6,000 miles.</p>
+<p>Our Lifetime Alignment service is a great investment compared to the Standard Alignment service. You&#8217;ll save in the long run knowing your car is properly aligned with regularly performed alignments for the entire time you own your car. We&#8217;ll align your car at any Firestone Complete Auto Care location in the country. That&#8217;s over 1,600 stores by the way.</p>

+<content>
+<![CDATA[<h2>Alignment Settings</h2>
+<p>The following settings are dependent on the intended use of your vehicle and manufacturer recommendations.</p>
+<h3>What does Camber mean&#63;</h3>
+<p>Camber plays a major role in your cornering and stability. Now, to give you a demonstration, you&#8217;re going to want to use your feet to best understand camber. Let&#8217;s get started.</p>
+<p>Stand up. No, really, stand up. Now, place all your weight on the outside of both feet. This is what is called &#8220;positive camber.&#8221; Now do the reverse and place all your weight on the inside of your feet. That&#8217;s &#8217;negative camber.&#8217; Positive camber is for stability, while negative camber is common in high performance vehicles that require better cornering.</p>
+<p><strong>Quick fact&#58;</strong> While some positive or negative camber is good, too much of either is bad.</p>
+<h3>How does camber differ for different types of vehicles&#63;</h3>
+<p>All vehicles are different&#58; An obvious fact that makes for an important point. While positive camber is used to improve ride quality and vehicle stability, high performance vehicles may require better cornering performance. Either way, your vehicle manufacturer will have the exact angles for this setting. We&#8217;ll use those angles to properly align the wheel camber.</p>
+<h3>How does suspension affect camber&#63;</h3>
+<p>Part of your suspension has these things called rubber bushings. Yes, this part has a funny name, but its importance is no laughing matter. Bushings can break down over time, allowing excessive movement to occur in the suspension. This additional flexibility leads to poor turning performance and accelerated and uneven tire wear.</p>
+<p>Having alignment issues&#63; <a href="/appointment/">Let&#8217;s get you back on the straight and narrow.</a></p>
+<h3>What does caster do for alignment&#63;</h3>
+<p>It&#8217;s all about straight lines with caster. Take a look at a bicycle. Trust us, this is going to be the best way to understand the caster setting. Caster is the reason your bicycle steers in a straight line even after you take your hands off the handlebar. That&#8217;s because the front spindle on your bicycle has a forward angle &#40;caster&#41; built in.</p>
+<p>Your car&#8217;s caster works in the same way. When your car travels straight down the road with little handling on your part, that&#8217;s due to your caster setting. If you&#8217;re driving down a straight path but start pulling to one side, that&#8217;s a sign your caster is off. We&#8217;ll get you all fixed up and realigned.</p>
+<p><strong>What does caster provide to your alignment&#63;</strong></p>
+<ul>
+    <li><strong>Directional stability&#58;</strong> The ability to stay on a straight course with little or no effort.
+    </li>
+    <li><strong>Returnability</strong> After completing a turn, your steering wheel spins back to the &#8220;straight ahead&#8221; position. You can thank the caster for that.
+    </li>
+</ul>
+<h3>Do caster settings change for different types of vehicles&#63;</h3>
+<p>Without a doubt. The caster angle is determined by your vehicle&#8217;s suspension design and the intended vehicle use. If you have a high speed, high performance ride, your sports car will need more caster to handle better on the straightaway and when coming out of turns. Can we get a vrooom over here&#63;</p>
+<h3>Can you detect a caster problem on your own&#63;</h3>
+<p>Sometimes. The most obvious and easiest sign to detect is if you feel your vehicle pulling to one side. This may mean your alignment needs adjustment. To be sure though, bring it to us and let us take a look.</p>
+<p><strong>Quick Fact&#58;</strong> Negative caster settings were more common when vehicles didn&#8217;t have power steering. That may be before your time, but inquiring minds want to know.</p>
+<h3>What does &#8220;toe in&#8221; or &#8220;toe out&#8221; refer to&#63;</h3>
+<p>Now to fully appreciate and understand this alignment angle, you&#8217;ll want to walk like a penguin. Now point your feet out. That is considered &#8220;toe out.&#8221; Ok, now point them inwards. That&#8217;s &#8220;toe in.&#8221; Pretty simple. Apply these position to your front and rear tires, and you&#8217;re now a toe alignment whiz. Go show off your new knowledge to your friends.</p>
+<strong>Knowing the Importance of &#8220;total toe.&#8221;</strong>
+<p>Total toe is meant to be at zero or close to zero while you&#8217;re cruising. If the total toe is off, severe tire wear can result. You see, proper toe settings make it possible for the least amount of resistance to occur when your tires spin. If the total toe is out of whack, you&#8217;ll experience uneven wear on the outside or inside part of your tires depending on whether your vehicle toe&#45;in or toe&#45;out setting is compromised.</p>
+<p><strong>Did you know&#63;</strong> Toe problems are the leading cause of most tire problems and tire wear. It&#8217;s easy to miss the signs of a toe alignment problem. Having your alignment performed as recommended &#40;approx. every 6,000 miles&#41; will help protect your tire investment in the long run. Less tires replaced, more money in your pocket.</p>

+<p>The thrust angle is the degree in which the back tires try to steer the front of the vehicle and is a major factor in your car&#8217;s ability to keep you cruising along a straight path. The more the thrust angle is off, the more the rear of the car will steer the front.</p>
+<strong>To align a vehicle accurately, it is important to understand the positions of all tires.</strong>
+<p>Whether your vehicle has a completely independent suspension or not doesn&#8217;t matter. It is critical to understand how the rear tires are pointed &#40;thrust angle&#41; to accurately adjust the front tires. It&#8217;s a complicated process, but we&#8217;ll get you pointed in the right direction.</p>
+<h3>How do excessive thrust angles affect my tires and suspension&#63;</h3>
+<p>When the thrust angle is off, it&#8217;s like walking a dog: you want to go one way, the dog wants to go the other. As it applies to your driving, if the back of the vehicle steers one way and the front another, then the vehicle is fighting itself and this causes excessive tire scrub and adds extra stress to steering and suspension components.</p>
+<p><strong>Quick fact&#58;</strong> Accelerated, damaging tire and suspension wear can occur in the scenario described above, so have your vehicle&#8217;s alignment checked, especially if you&#8217;re beyond the recommended 6,000 mile alignment interval.</p>
+<p><a href="/appointment/">Get an Alignment Check</a> and get back on the right path.</p>
+<h3>What is the geometric centerline&#63;</h3>
+<p>The geometric centerline is pretty much the center of the alignment universe. It&#8217;s the equator for your car. If you&#8217;re catching our drift, the geometric centerline is the line that every alignment angle is based off. It&#8217;s physically represented as the center line between the front two and back two tires. If you need a more tangible way to think about the centerline, mentally draw a line down the middle of your car from bumper to bumper.</p>
+<p>The geometric centerline is used&#58;</p>
+<ul>
+    <li>as a reference line for rear individual toe angles</li>
+    <li>as a reference line for thrust angle</li>
+</ul>
+<h3>What is a Steering Angle Sensor &#40;SAS&#41;&#63;</h3>
+<p>The Steering Angle Sensor, sometimes referred to as <abbr title="Steering Angle Sensor">SAS</abbr>, is an electronic monitoring device. Its sole purpose is to measure the position, force and  turning rate of your steering wheel. It then reports those results to the various vehicle systems depending on it.</p>
+<h4>A lot is riding on your SAS</h4>
+<p>Everything from your Electronic Stability Control to your Electric Power Steering is affected by the SAS and how you personally operate your vehicle. It is the job of the SAS to communicate and supply your unique driving habits so that your car steers in harmony with your driving habits.</p>
+<h4>After every alignment, the SAS must be reset</h4>
+<p>In order for your alignment settings to function properly, the SAS must be reset. This is necessary for your computer to correctly process the changes that have occurred and for your computer system to relay the correct information about your steering wheel position to the systems that depend on its information to function properly.</p>
+<h3>What is Steering Axis Inclination &#40;SAI&#41;&#63;</h3>
+<p>The Steering Axis Inclination &#40;<abbr title="Steering Axis Inclination">SAI</abbr>&#41; basically operates like your caster, helping your steering wheel return to the straight-ahead position after making a turn or changing lanes. SAI is not adjustable. So, if your SAI happens to be off, this means part of your suspension is damaged or worn and will need to be replaced in order for the SAI to function as intended.</p>
+<p>Symptoms that spell SAI trouble&#58;</p>
+<ul>
+    <li>Tires turning in or out as you&#8217;re attempting to drive straight ahead.
+    </li>
+    <li>Vehicle lifts slightly when you turn the wheel from the straight ahead position.
+    </li>
+</ul>
+<p>Steering Issues&#63; <a href="/appointment/">We can solve them</a>.</p>
+<h3>What does &#34;ride height&#34; have to do with a wheel alignment&#63;</h3>
+<p>Pretty much everything. You could say it&#8217;s the puppet master of your suspension. Your ride&#8217;s height will determine the positioning of everything controlling your ride.</p>
+<p>Your ride height will have a positive or negative effect on these components or alignment settings&#58;</p>
+<ol>
+    <li>Size and position of suspension and steering parts</li>
+    <li>Component mounting points</li>
+    <li>Range of motion of your steering</li>
+    <li>Static alignment angles</li>
+    <li>Intended use of the vehicle. Off road. High performance. All have different uses, and various specifications.</li>
+</ol>
+<p>Your ride height will need to be precise for your vehicle to be in perfect working order. All these factors are designed to ensure ultimate handling, performance and overall driving experience. All alignment angles will be based off your ride &#40;chassis&#41; height.</p>
+<p><strong>Quick Fact&#58;</strong> Ride height can be affected by lugging too much around in your trunk, or simply by fair wear and tear as your vehicle ages.</p>
+<p><strong>Did you know&#63;</strong> Every vehicle has a specific ride height. If it is below that height, that&#8217;s an indication that parts are worn and may need to be replaced in order for your car to align properly.</p>
+<p>Ready for the perfect alignment&#63; <a href="/appointment/">So are we</a>.</p>]]>

+<content>
+<![CDATA[<h2>Why is an oil change important&#63;</h2>
+<p>Why is regular bathing important&#63; It keeps you clean. Same goes for motor oil&#58; it gets &#8220;worn&#8221; during its lifecycle. Regularly scheduled oil changes will help keep your engine clean and avoid the potentially engine&#45;damaging effects contaminated oil can inflict. If you want to maximize engine performance, and most importantly, engine life, don&#8217;t skimp on your engine&#8217;s most vital lubricant.</p>
+<h2>How does motor oil breakdown&#63;</h2>
+<p>Oil is pretty temperamental. One second it is slick, but then, before you know it, slick mutates into &#8216;ick.&#8217; Let&#8217;s take a look at what&#8217;s going on in that engine of yours while you&#8217;re out cruising around.</p>
+<ul>
+    <li><strong>Motor oil becomes less effective over time.</strong> Constant exposure to heat, moisture and air leads to oil degradation &#40;oxidation&#41;. The end result&#63; Oil thickening, sludge, deposit formation and corrosive wear. Sounds awful, right&#63; Well it is, and all these nasty elements can take a toll on your engine. You don&#8217;t want those troublemakers knocking around your engine parts.</li>
+    <li><strong>Oil additives depleted, oil life finished.</strong> When oil additives are completely exhausted, oil can no longer handle the dirt and metals that are freely floating around, causing the oxidation that creates sludge. Most importantly, old oil can no longer protect your engine against corrosion and wear when it breaks down. Picture your engine oil trying to work its way through hard and sticky sludge that&#8217;s clogged up oil passageways in your engine. Doesn&#8217;t sound very effective, does it&#63; &#40;Not to mention all the havoc these added barriers can inflict on your engine.&#41; Leaving oil in your engine well past the recommended oil change date can result in disastrous conditions and expensive repairs.</li>
+</ul>
+<p>Changing your oil on schedule will remove contaminated oil and replenish your engine with fresh oil. Proper lubrication provides the best protection.</p>
+<h2>How does oil travel through my engine&#63;</h2>
+<p>Very smoothly. Oil is pumped through small engine passageways lubricating all moving parts while acting as a cooling agent to reduce engine heat. Talk about a pretty important job. Your engine&#8217;s survival is counting on it. Sit back and relax. We&#8217;ll show you how it works&#58;</p>
+<h2>What are all the parts involved in making sure the oil pumps through the engine effectively&#63;</h2>
+<ul>
+    <li><strong>The Moving Parts&#58;</strong> Valve train, main and rod bearings, piston rings and cylinder walls all need lubrication in order to prevent metal on metal friction in the engine.</li>
+    <li><strong>The Oil Pan&#58;</strong> This is where your oil chillaxes, waiting to be propelled into action by the oil pump. Once the pump gets the oil moving, the oil travels through tiny oil passage ways, lubricating all the functioning parts and then finally dropping back down to the oil pan. Cycle complete.</li>
+    <li><strong>The Oil Pump&#58;</strong> This part is crucial to engine lubrication. The oil pump is responsible for creating the pressure that pushes your oil throughout your engine parts. Without it, your oil would just sit in the pan. And that&#8217;s not very useful.</li>
+    <li><strong>The Oil Filter&#58;</strong> The oil filter captures any harmful debris, metal or dirt that&#8217;s entered your oil system. The better condition your oil filter is in, the better protected your engine will be. A dirty filter is as useful as a dirty napkin. And the only use for that is in the trash bin.</li>
+</ul>
+<h2>What are the technical differences between synthetic blend, high mileage and full synthetic oil types&#63;</h2>
+<p>Looks like we&#8217;ve got a future motor oil connoisseur on our hands &#8212; here&#8217;s a quick guide to understanding the different oil types&#58;</p>
+<ul>
+    <li><strong>Synthetic blend Kendall engine oils with Liquid Titanium&#174;</strong> are formulated with a mixture of synthetic base stocks and conventional base stocks combining the features and benefits of the synthetic and the cost benefits of the conventional base.</li>
+    <li><strong>High&#45;mileage Kendall engine oils with Liquid Titanium&#174;</strong> typically contain swelling additives to rejuvenate aging engine seals. Over time, these rubber seals dry out, crack and lose their flexibility. The swelling additive helps revitalize your seals so you can minimize physical &#40;external&#41; oil leaks as well as reduce exhaust smoke from internal oil leaks &#40;oil leaking past seals into the combustion chamber&#41;. High&#45;mileage oils may also be formulated with higher levels of antioxidant and&#47;or anti&#45;wear additives to provide better protection for older vehicles.</li>
+    <li><strong>Full&#45;synthetic Kendall engine oils with Liquid Titanium&#174;</strong> are 100% man&#45;made, offering performance benefits you won&#8217;t get from conventional oil&#58; better oxidation resistance at high temperatures for reduced dirt accumulation and longer service life; better low&#45;temperature effectiveness for easier starting and pump&#45;ability in cold weather. </li>
+</ul>
+<h2>What happens if I don&#8217;t get an oil change&#63;</h2>
+<p>Don&#8217;t play with fire, because that&#8217;s exactly what you&#8217;re doing with the life of your car if you wait too long to change your oil. Skipping oil changes, exceeding mileage or going long periods of time before your next oil change can accelerate the wear on the vital parts that keep your car running smoothly, eventually leading to premature engine breakdown.</p>
+<p>Repairing engine damage can be a big hit to your wallet, so don&#8217;t wait to get an oil change. You might regret it.</p>
+<p>Need the condition of your engine inspected&#63; <a href="/maintain/vehicleinspection.jsp">We can help</a>.</p>
+<h2>Can my oil change schedule differ from manufacturer recommendations&#63;</h2>
+<p>Believe it or not, it can &#8212; and often does. Check the manufacturer recommendation found in your owner&#8217;s manual. It typically lists oil change schedules for normal driving conditions and severe conditions. Make sure you pay attention to the listed driving conditions that distinguish the two. Severe conditions, such as hotter climates and frequent short trips, can shorten the life of your oil. If the change oil light appears, come in immediately if not sooner.</p>
+<h2>If my car has an &#8220;Oil Life System&#8221; can I change it less often&#63;</h2>
+<p>You&#8217;re on to something here. Oil Life Systems are a more recent advancement by automobile manufacturers and they&#8217;re designed to constantly monitor your driving conditions and mileage to determine the life expectancy of your oil. It&#8217;s common myth Oil Life System measures your oil condition. Although it measures mileage traveled and outside condition factors such as heat, your owner&#8217;s manual will provide you with a very clear oil change schedule based on your specific vehicle and driving conditions.</p>
+<p><strong>Quick Tip&#58;</strong> Think of regularly scheduled oil changes as cheap insurance against more expensive repairs. Not following manufacturer recommended oil change intervals can lead to sludge build up, resulting in engine damage and very costly repairs. Not fun. Check your owner&#8217;s manual for the recommended oil change interval based on the driving conditions you put your vehicle through.</p>
+<p><a href="/appointment/">Schedule your next oil change</a> with our oil experts.</p>
+<h2>What is the best type of oil for my car&#63;</h2>
+<p>The best type of oil is usually the one listed in your vehicle owner&#8217;s manual. However, if you have a high performance vehicle, do a lot of towing or live in extremely hot or cold climates, your car can benefit greatly from a synthetic blend or full synthetic oil.</p>
+<p><strong>Quick Tip&#58;</strong> Factor in the age of your vehicle when selecting your motor oil. When your car hits 75,000 miles, your engine may require a high mileage oil designed to maintain and preserve your engine for the long haul. All in the name of keeping your baby purring to its fullest potential.</p>
+<p><a href="/auto-services/oil/">Learn about the different types of Kendall Oils we carry</a>.</p>
+<h2>What do different oil grades &#40;SAE 5W&#45;20&#41; mean&#63;</h2>
+<p><strong>Caution&#58;</strong> As always, check with your owner&#8217;s manual and your oil tech before you make any adjustments to the oil grade you use in your engine. Pour in the wrong oil type and very damaging effects can occur.</p>
+<p>Now Let&#8217;s decode life&#8217;s biggest mystery&#58;</p>
+<ul>
+    <li><strong><abbr title="Society of Automotive Engineers">SAE</abbr> &#61; Society of Automotive Engineers.</strong>The SAE designation describes the viscosity grade of oil commonly used for passenger cars, vans, <abbr title="sport utility vehicle">SUV</abbr>&#8217;s, and light&#45;duty trucks, etc.</li>
+    <li><strong>W is for Winter.</strong> And the number before the W lets you know how easily this oil will pump at low temperatures. 0W is for very low temperatures, while higher numbers &#40;10W&#41; are designed for milder winter weather.</li>
+    <li><strong>The last number stands for &#8216;summer.&#8217;</strong> While the first number is associated with the winter temperatures, the last number determines the oil thickness at 100&#176;C. High numbers &#40;50&#41; are thicker than lower numbers &#40;20&#41; at that temperature.</li>
+    <li><strong>Thicker oils form a thicker file for better the high temperature protection.</strong> Heavier viscosity &#40;thicker&#41; oils provide superior protection at high temperatures, during towing and transporting heavy loads &#40;engine generates more heat under these operating conditions&#41;. When oil heats up, it thins out. If you drive under extreme conditions, thicker oil will perform better in your engine as it thins out under extreme temperatures.</li>
+    <li><strong>Thinner oils makes it easier to start your car in the winter.</strong> It&#8217;s the dead of winter; do you know the importance of your &#8216;W&#8217;&#63; Well it plays a big role in whether or not your car will start ease or, potentially, not at all. Lower numbers &#40;0W&#41; will perform the best in cold winter while higher &#40;20W&#41; numbers are designed for milder winter weather. Check with us to make sure you have the right oil for your region.</li>
+</ul>
+<p><strong>Warning&#58;</strong> Never switch oil types based on instincts or guesstimates. Check your owner&#8217;s manual first, but also check with one of our oil experts to determine the ideal oil grade based on your driving conditions and vehicle specifications.</p>
+<p><strong>Quick fact&#58;</strong> Multigrade oils &#40;10W&#45;30&#41; can be used over a wider temperature range than single grade oils.</p>
+<p>Call us and find the motor oil that suits your car best.</p>
+<h2>How does Kendall compare to other brands of motor oil&#63;</h2>
+<p>Kendall&#174; engine oils are designed to excel. They are engineered to meet or exceed industry standards and Original Equipment Manufacturer&#8217;s oil specifications for engine protection.</p>
+<p><strong>They are also enhanced with Liquid Titanium&#174;,</strong> a unique additive designed for greater wear protection and increased fuel economy. Liquid Titanium is only found in Kendall motor oils, available at all of our Firestone Complete Auto Care stores.</p>
+<h2>What is the advantage of Liquid Titanium&#63;</h2>
+<p>Liquid Titanium is advanced engine protection available in Kendall motor oil. Pretty cool, right&#63; With Liquid Titanium, you&#8217;ll have an extra layer of protection flowing through your engine to reduce friction among moving parts. Oil protects your engine by keeping it lubricated as the moving parts rub on one another and heat up. But what about when oil completes its cycle&#63; If it drops back down to your oil pan and doesn&#8217;t leave a residual bond, as Liquid Titanium does, metal on metal friction can occur.</p>
+<p>Liquid Titanium&#58;</p>
+<ul>
+    <li><strong>Superior engine protection under extreme operating conditions.</strong> This exclusive formula provides stronger protection for your hard working engine. By bonding to your engine&#8217;s critical parts Liquid Titanium gives your engine an extra layer of protection so you can reduce metal&#45;on&#45;metal friction under those brutal extreme conditions. With Liquid Titanium, you&#8217;ll now have extra protection to keep your engine running longer.</li>
+    <li><strong>Less Work. More efficiency. Energy conserved.</strong> With reduced friction among moving parts, it takes less work to keep the engine running. The result&#63; Increased fuel efficiency. It makes sense&#58; the less energy lost due to friction, the less fuel is consumed by your engine. With all the oil changes we perform, Liquid Titanium saved motorists almost 20 million gallons of gas, last year alone. Wow. But, another pay&#45;off&#63; Less carbon dioxide exhausted.  You can call Liquid Titanium &#8220;Energy Saving&#8221; and &#8220;Environment Protecting.&#8221;</li>
+</ul>
+<h2>What is a valve train&#63;</h2>
+<p>The valve train controls multiple parts in order to manage the amount of air and fuel that enters the combustion chamber at all times.</p>
+<h2>What are main and rod bearings&#63;</h2>
+<p>Main and rod bearings are half cylinder metal fittings that are lubricated so that the crankshaft, connecting rods and engine block function smoothly and avoid friction.</p>
+<h2>What are piston rings&#63;</h2>
+<p>Piston rings are typically a set of three rings that&#58; provide seals for the combustion chambers, transfer piston heat and manage engine oil consumption.</p>
+<h2>What are cylinder walls&#63;</h2>
+<p>Inside each cylinder are walls in which the pistons travel between. These walls must remain lubricated with oil at all times to ensure the pistons don&#8217;t create friction inside any of your vehicle&#8217;s cylinders.</p>
+<h2>What is a crankshaft&#63;</h2>
+<p>The crankshaft is connected to the pistons, providing precise and accurate piston rotation inside your vehicle&#8217;s cylinders. The crankshaft should always remain lubricated as it rotates inside the main and rod bearings.</p>
+<h2>Why choose Firestone Complete Auto Care vs. &#8216;fast lube&#8217; places&#63;</h2>
+<p>Most &#8220;In&#45;and&#45;out&#8221; oil change shops provide very limited benefits outside of a fast oil change. Firestone Complete Auto Care offers so much more.

+<![CDATA[<h2>What is engine sludge&#63;</h2>
+<p>Engine sludge is as nasty as it sounds, with more disgusting nicknames like &#8220;mayonnaise sludge&#8221; &#40;soft consistency&#41; and &#8220;black sludge&#8221; &#40;hard consistency&#41;. Sludge is old and congealed oil resulting from excessive contamination, heat and oil additive breakdown. Sludge typically forms over a long period of time and generally builds up when a vehicle owner skips oil changes or travels many miles past the recommended oil change interval.</p>
+<h2>How does engine damaging sludge form&#63;</h2>
+<p>One day your oil is shiny and slick but, over time, that incredible lubricant can become gunky and provide less effective protection for your engine parts. This is an extreme condition, but what could turn such a vital liquid into a gunky, engine clogging mess, you ask&#63;  Here are a couple scenarios.</p>
+<ul>
+    <li>Delaying your oil change is the main culprit. Over time, motor oil becomes contaminated with engine metals, acids and air humidity, eventually transforming into sludge.  Waiting too long to change your oil will increase the likelihood of sludge infecting all the parts where motor oil travels. So don&#8217;t be a slacker, get it changed&#33;</li>
+    <li>Don&#8217;t stress out your oil. Prolonged stress and under&#45;hood heat can lead to sludge filled consequences for your engine oil. Humidity plays a big role in oil consistency. The more humidity that enters your oil system, the sludgier and harder the oil gets. Relieve some stress by changing your oil regularly before it wears out.</li>
+</ul>
+<p>Sludge is no laughing matter. Allowing it to build up could mean serious trouble for your engine. Follow your vehicle&#8217;s recommended oil change intervals, take into account your driving habits, and save yourself the aggravation engine damaging sludge creates.</p>
+<h2>How do driving conditions affect oil&#63;</h2>
+<p>Oil is kind of a drama queen. It only can withstand so much before it starts to become a hot mess.</p>
+<p>Ask yourself the following questions. If you answer &#8216;yes&#8217; to any of these, call us. Seriously. A yes to any of these questions means you could probably benefit from an oil change more frequently to ensure your engine&#8217;s protected.</p>
+<ul>
+    <li><strong>Do you constantly drive in high temperature conditions&#63;</strong> Excessive heat causes the oil to breakdown resulting in sludge and engine deposits. High temperatures also cause oil to thin out; typically resulting in metal on metal grinding or wear in your engine. Ouch. Trust us, it&#8217;s as bad as it sounds. This problem typically can become even more severe if you tow heavy loads or if you leave your car running idle for extended periods of time. A higher grade oil will greatly benefit your vehicle in this situation. And that&#8217;s why we offer a full range of quality motor oils, honed by the liquid engineers at Kendall motor oils.</li>
+    <li><strong>Do you frequently drive short distances&#63;</strong> Get this&#58; Repeated short distance driving means your oil may not have time to reach optimal operating temperatures. This enables water &#40;condensation&#41; and combustion bi&#45;products, such as smoke, to dilute oil, accelerating the breakdown of your oil and shortening the lifespan of your engine components.</li>

+<p>It&#8217;s all about the extremes. Very hot or very cold temperatures will cause faster oil breakdown, requiring oil changes sooner. Here&#8217;s why.</p>
+<ul>
+    <li><strong>Surviving frigid temperatures requires thinner oils.</strong> If you live in a very cold climate your oil gets thicker as the temperature drops. The end result&#63; Oil is harder to pump during startup, potentially leading to accelerated engine wear and difficulty starting your vehicle. Remember, thinner oils are ideal during winter. The lower the grade &#40;0W&#41;, the thinner the oil, the easier your car will start during those deep freezes.<br /><strong>Note&#58;</strong> Always make sure you are adding the proper Motor Oil to your vehicle. Check your owner&#8217;s manual or call us to determine the proper oil grade for your vehicle.</li>
+    <li><strong>Thrive during hotter temperatures with heavier oils.</strong> For hotter climates, constant towing or idling, thicker oils are a must. That&#8217;s because hot under&#45;hood temperatures can cause your motor oil to breakdown and thin out. If you don&#8217;t have a thick enough oil running through your system, your oil can become too thin, leaving engine parts exposed to metal&#45;on&#45;metal contact. Trust us, you don&#8217;t want to hear that sound.</li>
+</ul>
+<p>Oil is a fickle friend. Make sure to double check your owner&#8217;s manual and check with your oil technician for the proper oil for your region.</p>
+<h2>How do I check the condition of my oil&#63;</h2>
+<p>Unfortunately, simply looking at the oil or rubbing it between your fingers won&#8217;t tell you everything that is going on inside your engine. Wouldn&#8217;t that be convenient&#63; Some symptoms that may indicate a problem with your oil are&#58; low oil pressure, engine overheating or difficulty starting in cold weather.</p>
+<p>Check it yourself&#58; Visually examining oil on your oil dipstick may help identify excessive oil thickening or water contamination.</p>
+<ul>
+    <li><strong>Step 1&#58;</strong> Park your car on a level surface. Parking on an incline will give you an inaccurate reading of your oil level when you pull the dipstick out.</li>
+    <li><strong>Step 2&#58;</strong> Wait until the engine is cold &#40;oil expands when it is hot&#41;.</li>
+    <li><strong>Step 3&#58;</strong> Is the engine cold&#63; If not, go back to Step 2.</li>
+    <li><strong>Step 4&#58;</strong> Withdraw the dipstick, wipe it with a paper towel or rag, and reinsert it all the way back until it&#8217;s back in place. Now, withdraw the dipstick again, hold it horizontally, and read the oil level on the dipstick &#40;every dipstick has a safe oil level indicator&#41;. </li>
+    <li><strong>Step 5&#58;</strong> How does the oil look&#63; Before you reinsert the dipstick, check the oil consistency. If your dipstick has a white, milky discoloration, this means excessive moisture has entered your motor oil. In this case, set up an oil change as soon as possible.</li>
+    <li><strong>Step 6&#58;</strong> Add oil as necessary by unscrewing the oil filler cap, which is about 3 inches in diameter and located on the very top of the engine and typically labeled &#8216;Engine Oil.&#8217;  </li>
+    <li><strong>Step 7&#58;</strong> Recheck the oil level with your dipstick to make sure you&#8217;ve added enough oil.</li>
+    <li><strong>Step 8&#58;</strong> Screw on Engine Oil cap and make sure it is secured tightly.</li>
+    <li><strong>Step 9&#58;</strong> Get an oil change. If your oil level is low, how long has it been since your last oil change&#63; It may be time to schedule one.</li>
+</ul>
+<p>Have more oil change questions&#63; Ask one of our techs.</p>
+<h2>How does oil affect fuel efficiency&#63;</h2>
+<p>It&#8217;s a matter of thickness. The thicker the oil, the more energy &#40;fuel burned&#41; needed to pump it. More energy usage equals less fuel efficiency. That&#8217;s why newer vehicles are designed to operate on lower viscosity oils. The lighter the oil, the less energy required to pump it.</p>
+<p><strong>Caution&#58;</strong> Always make sure you are using the right oil for your car so your engine doesn&#8217;t have to work harder than it needs to, resulting in sluggish performance.</p>
+<p><strong>Quick Fact&#58;</strong> Added &#8216;friction modifiers&#8217; in our Kendall oil require less energy. Friction modifiers help oil flow through your engine with greater ease, requiring even less energy than traditional oils. Again, less energy to pump oil equals greater fuel efficiency for you.</p>
+<h2>What are some environmental facts regarding oil changes&#63;</h2>
+<p>Some may call it &#8216;black gold,&#8217; but we all know disposing of oil improperly is damaging to the environment. You&#8217;ve seen the effects an oil spill has on wildlife. Now imagine if we disposed of oil the same way. And, believe us, people have, and sadly, still do.</p>
+<p>Here are the wrong ways to dispose of oil&#58;</p>
+<ul>
+    <li>Emptying it in the trash</li>
+    <li>Pouring it down sewers and, consequently, into our water supply</li>
+    <li>Dumping it on the ground</li>
+</ul>
+<h2>What&#8217;s the proper way to dispose of oil&#63;</h2>
+<p>The only proper way to dispose of oil is to take it to a facility that accepts used oil for proper disposal or recycling &#8212; like us. We make it easy. Every time you bring your vehicle in for an oil change, we&#8217;ll make sure your old oil is disposed of properly.</p>
+<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> If you do your own oil change, we&#8217;d be glad to take care of your old oil, too.</p>
+<h2>What does my change oil soon light mean&#63;</h2>
+<p>It could mean a few things. But, in most cases, it means you need an oil change. <abbr title="as soon as possible">ASAP</abbr>. Don&#8217;t ignore the change oil soon light. It&#8217;s time for a fresh oil change.</p>
+<h2>What&#8217;s an oil life system indicator light&#63;</h2>
+<p>Many vehicles are now equipped with high tech ways to constantly monitor your driving conditions and mileage to determine the life expectancy of your oil. When the Oil Life System light appears, your computer system has determined you&#8217;ve reached the life expectancy for your current oil. Don&#8217;t doubt your oil life system indicator. It&#8217;s very reliable, accurate and always looking out for your engine&#8217;s best interests.</p>
+<h2>What happens after you reset the oil light&#63;</h2>
+<p>After an oil change, we reset your oil light. Your car computer can now restart the process of counting the miles traveled since your most recent oil change. Ah, intelligent vehicles, where would the automotive world be without them&#63; Your car computer is extremely accurate, so don&#8217;t second guess or disregard its analysis.</p>
+<p><strong>Quick Tip&#58;</strong> This system is not universal for all vehicle manufacturers. Check your owner&#8217;s manual for an explanation about how the system functions in your vehicle.</p>
+<h2>What are common myths about oil changes&#63;</h2>
+<p>These may surprise you. But, rest assured, these myths are, in fact, myths.</p>
+<ul>
+    <li><strong>Change your oil every 3,000 miles.</strong> The myth to end all myths. There once was a time when this mileage interval was the standard. However, times have changed. Today&#8217;s oils and vehicles are of higher quality and capable of handling longer mileage intervals for most vehicles.</li>
+    <li><strong>Synthetic oils are bad for seals.</strong> Engine seals are the little rubber parts that prevent oil leaks, and there&#8217;s a rumor out there that seal failure is caused by synthetic oils. Though that was a possibility many years ago when synthetics were first formulated, today&#8217;s synthetic oils have advanced greatly in makeup and engine protection. Bottom line&#58; seals do age with time but not because of synthetic oils. So use synthetic all you want. We even have a Kendall GT&#45;1&#174; High Mileage Synthetic Blend Motor Oil that is specially formulated with a seal swell additive to help minimize seal deterioration and oil leaks.</li>
+    <li><strong>Synthetic Oils Leak.</strong> This is a rumor that just won&#8217;t go away. But, rest assured, Synthetic oils don&#8217;t create or cause leaks. Now, to set the record straight, oil leaks can occur with synthetics if there&#8217;s already an opening. That&#8217;s because synthetics contain smaller molecules than conventional oils and can enter smaller crevices. But, take note, all the synthetic is detecting is a pre&#45;existing and evolving leak &#8212; not creating it. In fact, the leak would eventually be exposed by conventional oil as the crack becomes larger.</li>
+</ul>

+<h2>What are some future trends in motor oil&#63;</h2>
+<p>Every driver wants fewer oil changes. Luckily for you, the time between oil changes has increased with the increased sophistication of newer cars. The future is all about increasing engine endurance. That&#8217;s why Kendall Oils is always improving their oils to protect your engine over longer intervals. As engine technology and oil keeps improving, the time that can pass before an oil change will be longer and longer.</p>
+<p>Oil Life Systems are a recent addition by automobile manufacturers. The oil life system constantly monitors your driving conditions and mileage to determine the life expectancy of your oil. Although it measures mileage traveled and outside condition factors such as heat, double check your owner&#8217;s manual as well. It will provide you with a very accurate oil change schedule based on your vehicle and driving conditions.</p>

+<![CDATA[<h2>How much oil does my car need&#63;</h2>
+<p>Enough to keep the tin man lubricated. All joking aside, some automobiles only need three quart capacity while bigger vehicles can need up to 15 quarts &#8212; quite the range. Your auto manufacturers list the oil quantities required for your engine in your owner&#8217;s manual.</p>
+<h2>What is the best day to get an oil change&#63;</h2>
+<p>So, you want to know the industry&#8217;s best kept secret, eh&#63; Well, from our experience, Tuesdays and Wednesdays are usually the best days to stop into Firestone Complete Auto Care. Now that we&#8217;ve said that, we can&#8217;t guarantee those will not become the most popular days as a result. But you asked. And now the cat is out of the bag. See you Tuesday or Wednesday.</p>
+<p>We even have extended evening hours and most stores are open Sundays. <a href="/appointment/">Schedule an oil change</a> for any day of the week.</p>
+<h2>Do I need an appointment to get an oil change&#63;</h2>
+<p>You don&#8217;t need one. But, we know how much you value your time. Scheduling an appointment will give you the benefit of servicing your car on your schedule. While we can change your oil on a whim, we can&#8217;t guarantee you&#8217;ll be serviced on the spot. That will depend on if &#8212; and how many &#8212; customers arrived before you. We can give you a heads up beforehand, just call us. Tuesdays and Wednesdays are generally the best days to stop in without an appointment. Appointment or not, you&#8217;ll receive the impeccable service and the same attention and care we provide each and every vehicle we service.</p>
+<p>Have your oil changed on your schedule by <a href="/appointment/">scheduling yours</a> today.</p>
+<h2>What is included with an oil change purchase&#63;</h2>
+<p>A whole slew of things. We don&#8217;t just perform the basics like a lot of oil change shops. We inspect your vehicle too, so you can avoid future problems.</p>
+<p>All our oil change services include&#58;</p>
+<ul>
+    <li>Installation of up to 5 quarts of Kendall&#174; motor oil</li>
+    <li>Installation of new filter</li>
+    <li>lubricating chassis &#40;if necessary&#41;</li>
+    <li>3&#45;month&#47;3,000&#45;mile warranty</li>

+<ul>
+    <li>wiper blades</li>
+    <li>head, tail and mini lights</li>
+    <li>air filter</li>
+    <li>fluid levels</li>
+    <li>belts and hoses</li>
+    <li>battery</li>
+    <li>tires</li>
+</ul>
+<p><a href="/appointment/">Schedule an oil change today</a>.</p>
+<h2>Why does Firestone recommend other services when I want just an oil change&#63;</h2>
+<p>We&#8217;ll never recommend anything we wouldn&#8217;t recommend to our mothers. We care about your automobile, and that includes the worn parts that typically go unnoticed and undetected at the in&#45;and&#45;out oil change shop.</p>
+<p>We&#8217;ll offer you a free courtesy 19 point inspection. The inspection is designed to detect obvious signs of wear and tear. It&#8217;s a very simple way to take care of the services you need at the store, instead of requiring you to schedule another appointment. A more comprehensive inspection is available as well.</p>
+<p>We care about your car, but most importantly, we care about you. Small problems can become big problems. We&#8217;ll keep tabs on your manufacturer&#8217;s recommended maintenance, to help keep your vehicle maintained.</p>
+<h2>How are technicians trained to do an oil change at Firestone&#63;</h2>
+<p>We train our technicians to perform oil change services using a combination of our own e&#45;learning and training guides along with on&#45;the&#45;job coaching and mentoring. We also have over 2,200 technicians on staff ASE certified in general maintenance.</p>
+<ul>
+    <li><strong>Know&#45;how and expertise.</strong> Firestone Complete Auto Care technicians are instructed to follow manufacturer and industry approved servicing procedures while following the most stringent safety precautions.</li>
+    <li><strong>Sticklers for detail.</strong> Using the latest technology, Firestone Complete Auto Care electronically provides technicians with individual vehicle specs for exact oil quantity and viscosity for your make and model.</li>
+</ul>
+<h2>What does the oil filter do&#63;</h2>
+<p>Just as a water filter traps tiny particles from entering your drinking water, an oil filter catches dirt and other harmful debris before it can enter your engine. It&#8217;s replaced when we perform an oil change.</p>
+<h2>Does Firestone Complete Auto Care use a quality oil filter&#63;</h2>
+<p>Our oil filters are Champions in name and quality. Champion Labs is our trusted supplier of oil filters. Their oil filters not only meet, but typically exceed original equipment requirements for fit, function and quality construction.</p>
+<p>Champion Labs is the world&#8217;s largest supplier of filters, offering filters for everything from air to fuel to transmission filters. They&#8217;re the go&#45;to&#45;choice for many industries including&#58; heavy&#45;duty trucking, construction equipment and mining industries as well as the marine, farm machinery and industrial engine markets.</p>
+<p>Learn more about Champion Labs oil filters at <a href="http://www.champlabs.com" rel="nofollow" class="external">champlabs.com</a></p>
+<h2>Why does Firestone charge for oil filter disposal&#63;</h2>
+<p>Many states mandate disposal of oil in certain ecological ways. And we&#8217;re a big advocate of protecting the environment by providing an oil filter disposal service everyone can count on.</p>
+<p><strong>Get this&#58;</strong> the disposal fee we charge goes directly to paying the recycling cost to the recycling service we use. This fee covers the cost of labor, handling, storage, space, utilities and more. All in the name of providing you with sweet service and doing our part to protect the environment.</p>
+<h2>What do we do with used oil&#63;</h2>
+<p>They say one man&#8217;s disposed oil is another man&#8217;s treasure. After properly recycling your oil with our vendors, it&#8217;s given a second life as fuels and lubricants.  It even becomes re&#45;refined motor oil in our EcoPower oil, which we use in select stores.</p>
+<p>You see, used oil isn&#8217;t useless oil. It means less oil being pulled out of the ground and a lesser impact on the environment. It just takes the right engineers to refine and reuse the oil components. We accept used oil at no charge. Bring in your used oil during store hours and allow us to dispose of it properly.</p>
+<h2>What is the warranty on a Firestone Complete Auto Care oil change&#63;</h2>
+<p>Oil changes come with a 3 month, 3,000 mile warranty. It&#8217;s also the reason a sticker is placed on your windshield telling you to come back in 3 months or 3,000 miles.</p>
+<p>Now, you can operate past 3,000 miles on your current oil if your car manufacturer states a longer oil change interval. Check your owner&#8217;s manual to learn more about your particular vehicle&#8217;s oil specifications. Many cars today are designed to maintain oil for more miles.</p>
+<h2>How does Firestone protect my car during an oil change&#63;</h2>
+<p>We treat your car like we&#8217;d treat our own, with the utmost attention. From fender covers to floor mats to steering wheel and seat covers, we take pride in delivering stellar service and care while your vehicle is in our hands.</p>
+<h2>Does Firestone offer a 10&#45;minute oil change&#63;</h2>
+<p>The short and honest answer&#58; no. Most oil changes are completed within 30 minutes, but can run longer depending on how busy we are at the moment. Scheduling an oil change appointment is the best way to shorten the wait time.</p>
+<p>Our goal is to keep your car running newer, longer. And that takes a little extra care. Just think of us as your car doctor. You wouldn&#8217;t see a doctor whose goal is to get you out as fast as possible so he can move on to the next in line. Same philosophy applies to your vehicle. Allowing proper time to fully service your vehicle during an oil change is our way of providing you with the best and most complete service.</p>
+<p><strong>Quick Tip&#58;</strong> Request our free courtesy check and we&#8217;ll visually inspect all fluid levels, belts, hoses, tires and air pressure.  While that may take a few extra minutes, we think it will save you a few headaches too, should anything need to be replaced.</p>
+<h2>Does getting an oil change with us void my vehicle&#8217;s warranty coverage&#63;</h2>
+<p>No. Who told you that nonsense&#63;&#33; As long as you&#8217;re using the manufacturer recommended oil grade &#40;i.e. 5W20&#41; and get oil changes on schedule, you&#8217;re good to go.</p>
+<h2>How can I save on an oil change&#63;</h2>
+<p>Here, let us grease your engine towards future savings.</p>
+<p>Save yourself some money by following any one of these tips&#58;</p>
+<ul>
+    <li><strong>Only get an oil change every 3,000 miles, if necessary.</strong> Bet you didn&#8217;t think we&#8217;d say that. Newer vehicles have been engineered to handle longer maintenance intervals.  Check your owner&#8217;s manual for the recommended intervals for your vehicle. However, pay attention, factors such as driving conditions and driving habits can determine how frequently you&#8217;ll need to change your oil.</li>
+    <li><strong>Be a coupon watcher.</strong> We&#8217;re always looking out for your wallet. If you&#8217;re on a tight budget, keep an eye out for <a href="/offers/">our latest oil change deals</a>.</li>
+    <li><strong>Do it yourself.</strong> Do you enjoy the smell of hot burnt oil and the feeling of it dripping down your arms&#63; What about the hassle of disposing of the old oil properly&#63; Talk about time consuming. If those scenarios aren&#8217;t your cup of tea, allow us to get our hands dirty for you. Bring it to us and we&#8217;ll have you ready to go in no time.</li>

+        <h2>Maintenance</h2>
+        <h3>Why is an car maintenance important&#63;</h3>
+<p>The simple answer&#58; to help keep your car running newer, longer. By letting us perform routine maintenance, you&#8217;ll help spare bigger car trouble.</p>
+<p>Lapsing maintenance on your car&#8217;s vital fluid exchanges, dirty filters, fussy belts and old spark plugs can lead to bigger problems like busted&#45;up radiators, slipping gear shifts and engine failure. That&#8217;s why routine maintenance is key to vehicle longevity. Maintenance you think you can &#8220;let go&#8221; in the short term can often be an &#8220;oh, no&#33;&#8221; down the road.</p>
+<p>Your manufacturer has designed a maintenance schedule &#40;found in your owner&#8217;s manual&#41; around the specific makeup of your particular vehicle. Follow this schedule and chances are your vehicle will deliver optimal performance as you rack up the miles, help your parts last longer and save you some dough on more expensive replacement parts.</p>
+<h3>How often should I have routine maintenance performed&#63;</h3>
+<p>Each car, <abbr title="sport utility vehicle">SUV</abbr>, truck or van manufacturer lists time and mileage intervals for routine maintenance, inspections and part replacement. Some service intervals are shorter, requiring more frequent maintenance, while other maintenance intervals are longer, occurring once or twice over the life of your vehicle.</p>
+<p>Some vehicles have internal clocks that alert you to when you need maintenance as well. Heed those indicator lights.</p>
+<p>Of course, if you need work sooner, we&#8217;re here to help between recommended intervals.  <a href="/maintenance/schedule.jsp">Find your vehicle&#8217;s recommended maintenance intervals</a>.</p>

+<h3>Will the expense of car maintenance &#8220;pay off&#8221; in the long run&#63;</h3>
+<p>Regular maintenance for your ride is a wise decision, my friend &#8211; both for the longevity of your car and the length of your dollar. Regular maintenance helps prevent having to replace more expensive parts.</p>
+<p>Let&#8217;s take an oil change for an average sedan over 100,000 miles as an example. During those miles, you&#8217;d change your oil about 25 times &#40;an oil change every 4,000 miles&#41;. Assuming the average cost of the oil change is about &#36;25, you&#8217;ll spend &#36;625 on oil changes overall. If you were to go without an oil change during that period, your engine would likely flood with contaminants and eventually seize. The reason&#63; Thick, dirty oil that can&#8217;t properly lubricate vital parts, leading to <span class="nowrap">metal&#45;on&#45;metal</span> friction. The result&#63; One cost&#45;prohibitive roadblock&#58; an engine replacement that hovers around &#36;4,000.</p>
+<p>You can find all recommended maintenance intervals in your vehicle&#8217;s owner&#8217;s manual. Or, you can locate it all right here on our website.</p>

+        <h2>Bulb Replacement</h2>
+        <h3>How many different bulbs are there in the average vehicle&#63;</h3>
+<p>More than most Christmas trees. For real. And it&#8217;s not just fog lights, turn signals and rear, mirror and side bulbs you&#8217;ll have to contend with. Bulbs are everywhere, especially on vehicles with fancy <abbr title="Light&#45;Emitting Diode">LED</abbr> bulbs&#58; they can feature over 100 bulbs in the rear of the vehicle alone. These bulbs will last varying amounts of time, so inspect your vehicle regularly to make sure no crucial rear or front lights are out.</p>
+<p>Bulb out&#63; Let&#8217;s get your lights shining again. <a href="/appointment/">Schedule an appointment</a>.</p>
+<h3>How long do bulbs typically last&#63;</h3>
+<p>Bulb life varies, so it&#8217;s important to get your vehicle inspected on a regular basis. We can spot burn&#45;outs with our free courtesy check which is available with any service &#8211; even a routine oil change. Ask for a free courtesy check next time you&#8217;re in and we&#8217;ll visually inspect your ride, including all the lights. If a bulb is out or weak, we&#8217;ll let you know &#8211; and bring back the shine.</p>
+<p>Shine on with a new bulb. <a href="/appointment/">Schedule an appointment</a>.</p>
+<h3>How many vehicles on the road today have burned out exterior bulbs&#63;</h3>
+<p>One of every three vehicles has a light that&#8217;s burned out. With so many lights on vehicles these days, it&#8217;s inevitable. It&#8217;s easy to assume that a person not using their turn signal is a reckless driver. However, with a 33&#37; chance that person may have a bulb burned out, they might not even know they have a burnout.</p>
+<p><strong>Stay alert.</strong> If you notice people honking or blinking their lights at you for what seems like no reason at all, don&#8217;t lose your cool. They may be trying to tell you something very important&#58; one of your lights is out. Then again, maybe they&#8217;re just not very nice.</p>
+<p>Bulb out&#63; Come in. <a href="/appointment/">Schedule an appointment</a>.</p>
+<h3>Beyond the obvious benefit of better lighting, are there any other benefits of bulb replacement&#63;</h3>
+<p>Sure, light is a boon if you&#8217;re afraid of the dark. When you&#8217;re talking about headlights, it&#8217;s also integral to increasing visibility &#8211; for you and others &#8211; when traveling down dark stretches of road. Working turn signals and brake lights are of utmost importance, too. They decrease the likelihood of a collision by enabling other drivers to see you and anticipate your intended actions on the road.</p>
+<p>Time for new bulbs&#63; <a href="/appointment/">Locate your Firestone Complete Auto Care</a>.</p>
+<h3>What is the biggest factor that leads to bulb burn&#45;outs&#63;</h3>
+<p>Condensation and moisture buildup are the biggest bulb killers. Let&#8217;s face it, water and electrical devices were never meant to coexist.</p>
+<p>With a free courtesy check, we can look for condensation buildup inside any bulb casings, especially your headlights. Condensation may mean your tail or headlight assembly is damaged and needs replacement.</p>
+<p>Get your bulbs replaced. <a href="/appointment/">Schedule an appointment</a>.</p>
+<h3>Why do you have to replace the entire headlight casing when it&#8217;s just the bulb that has burned out&#63;</h3>
+<p>Some auto manufacturers require a brand new headlight kit to be installed rather than just replacing the bulb. And if part of your headlight casing is damaged or missing, many manufacturers don&#8217;t supply individual replacement parts for headlight housing.</p>
+<p>This is true with popular LED lights. Any lights on a LED fixture will require the entire light assembly to be replaced. While it&#8217;s true this usually costs more than just a bulb replacement, you&#8217;ll have brand new manufacturer equipment, which is always a plus.</p>
+<p>Replacing an entire headlight casing, sometimes, can be the best thing that happened to your headlight. The reason&#63; A broken or missing casing part may lead to future malfunctions and burn&#45;outs.</p>
+<p>Time for new headlights&#63; <a href="/appointment/">Schedule an appointment</a>.</p>
+<h3>How can you tell if a bulb is about to burn out&#63;</h3>
+<p>You can&#8217;t, unless you have burned&#45;out&#45;bulb <abbr title="extrasensory perception">ESP</abbr>. If you have this unique skill, please call us, as we&#8217;d like to employ you. All kidding aside, the only true indication that a bulb is about to burn out is if you notice one or both your headlights appear dimmer than normal.</p>
+<h3>How do I detect a burned out turn signal&#63;</h3>
+<p>A turn signal that blinks faster, or one that is supposed to be on but never blinks, are both indicators. If you notice your turn signal behaving this way, that&#8217;s a warning from your car that one of the turn signal bulbs is burned out. Not all cars have these burn&#45;out indication features though, so make be sure to inspect your vehicle periodically.</p>
+<p><strong>Although exterior bulb burn&#45;outs are hard to detect while you&#8217;re driving</strong>, it&#8217;s important to check your exterior lights on a semi&#45;regular basis. Some people go months or &#8211; gasp &#8211; years without noticing a very important bulb is burned out. Bulb replacement is a must to let other drivers know you&#8217;re there or what your intentions are when moving on the road.</p>
+<p>Ask for a free courtesy check, and we&#8217;ll check all your bulbs for you. <a href="/appointment/">Schedule a free courtesy check</a>.</p>
+<p>Time for new bulbs&#63; <a href="/appointment/">Schedule an appointment</a>.</p>
+<h3>Do you offer headlight condensation service&#63;</h3>
+<p>Yes, we do inherently. This is because condensation and moisture buildup in your headlights can result in burned&#45;out bulbs or reduced output. We get rid of the bulb condensation by changing the bulb and/or casing. What&#8217;s worse is when water collects in headlights because it can damage your car&#8217;s electrical system. With this service, we&#8217;ll make sure condensation is eliminated by replacing the bulb and casing, if necessary.</p>
+<h3>Which bulbs does Firestone Complete Auto Care carry&#63;</h3>

+<h2>Wiper Blade Replacement</h2>
+<h3>How long do wiper blades generally last&#63;</h3>
+<p>Wiper longevity depends on where you live. Heat really wears on those rubber windshield squeegees; therefore, if you live in a hot climate, wipers will inevitably require more frequent replacement. Accordingly, if you use your wipers often &#8211; and live in a rainy, snowy or icy neck of the country &#8211; expect a shortened blade life.</p>
+<p><strong>A general wiper blade rule of thumb&#58;</strong> if wipers smear water or snow and obstruct your view when they swoosh by, it&#8217;s time for new blades.</p>
+<p>Worn blades&#63; <a href="/appointment/">Get them replaced at your nearest Firestone Complete Auto Care</a>.</p>
+<h3>Why don&#8217;t wiper blades last longer&#63;</h3>
+<p>Wiper blades may be one of the most misunderstood parts in automotive history. After all, they&#8217;re the only true functioning component that is completely exposed to the nasty outside elements, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days of the year. Talk about a tough life. And a tough job keeping visibility clear &#8211; whatever the weather.</p>
+<p>Given these factors, it&#8217;s no wonder something so small, thin and crucial can only provide optimal visibility for so long.</p>
+<p>Retire your old blades. And get new Bosch wiper blades. <a href="/appointment/">Schedule an appointment</a>.</p>
+<h3>What are the biggest factors that cause wiper blades to wear down&#63;</h3>
+<p>Your wipers are exposed to the outside world day in and day out, which means everything from heat and rain to snow, road salt and ice all have an effect. On top of these factors, blades just wear down over time with repeated use.</p>
+<p>Have fresh, new Bosch wiper blades installed today. <a href="/appointment/">Schedule an appointment</a>.</p>
+<h3>What happens as wiper blades get older&#63;</h3>
+<p>All that sun. All that heat. All that use. All these factors affect the life of your wiper blades. As your rubber wiper blades endure the elements, they start losing their flexibility and become brittle. The rubber cracks and tears. The blades wear down, exposing metal. Eventually, you&#8217;re left with blades that streak and smudge, making it more difficult to see all that&#8217;s ahead of you. Worst of all, if the rubber runs out on the blade, the metal underneath can scratch your windshield. Yikes.</p>
+<p>Renew your ride with new Bosch wiper blades. <a href="/appointment/">Schedule an appointment</a>.</p>
+<h3>Will I be able to tell a difference when I have my wiper blades replaced&#63;</h3>
+<p>Replacing your blades can be like taking a blindfold off of your eyes. Better functionality will lead to better visibility. Our selection of Bosch wiper blades come highly regarded by the automotive industry, thanks to advanced design and superior quality. New Bosh wiper blades deliver stellar visibility.</p>
+<p>Have fresh, new Bosch wiper blades installed today. <a href="/appointment/">Schedule an appointment</a>.</p>
+<h3>What are some symptoms that you need new wiper blades&#63;</h3>
+<p>Smearing, smudging, streaking, rubbing, scraping on your windshield. If your swooshes don&#8217;t sound right, look right, or, most importantly, if you can&#8217;t see well when your blades go back and forth, it&#8217;s time for a wiper replacement.</p>

+        <h2>Coolant Fluid Exchange</h2>
+        <h3>What is the job of coolant fluid&#63;</h3>
+<p>It&#8217;s the working fluid for the cooling system, which controls the operational condition of the engine. Because the engine is a controlled explosion, it needs to be kept between a specific temperature range for optimal performance. Whether it&#8217;s cold or hot outside, the cooling fluid allows the cooling system &#40;including the radiator&#41; to keep the engine and radiator at just the right temperature. Think of this way&#58; coolant fluid is a warm blanket in the winter and a misting fan in the summer.</p>
+<h3>How does coolant fluid flow through the system&#63;</h3>
+<p>A car&#8217;s coolant system operates on a loop, pumping a mix of water and antifreeze to your radiator to regulate engine temperature. Because coolant absorbs the heat generated by the engine and transports it to the radiator to cool down, it stands to reason that low or weak coolant levels mean its job performance is compromised and your car can overheat.</p>
+<h3>Why is a coolant fluid exchange so important&#63;</h3>
+<p>Coolant breaks down like any other engine fluid. Just as motor oil has vital engine performance additives, your coolant has additives that prevent boiling, freezing and corrosion. When these additives are depleted, contaminants and debris can begin to build up on your radiator, affecting its performance. It&#8217;s essential to have your coolant fluid exchanged every so often. And by the way, coolant spelled backward is tnalooc &#8211; a word that makes absolutely no sense.</p>
+<h3>How often should a coolant exchange be performed on my vehicle&#63;</h3>
+<p>Surprise, surprise&#58; vehicles don&#8217;t need new coolant over the same time periods. Some vehicles have long&#45;life fluids pre&#45;installed on the assembly line and don&#8217;t require servicing as often. So, go ahead and jump up and down if you&#8217;re one of the lucky ones with longer life fluids. You win.</p>
+<p>For all the <strong>non&#45;long&#45;life fluid vehicle owners</strong> out there, you may require a coolant exchange as frequently as every 15,000 miles. You can find coolant information &#8211; and learn when it needs to be replaced &#8211; in your vehicle&#8217;s owner&#8217;s manual.</p>
+<h3>What is the benefit of having a coolant fluid exchange performed&#63;</h3>
+<p>Pun intended&#58; it all boils down to your vehicle operating at an ideal temperature. Old coolant can cause overheating. No coolant or low coolant levels can lead to ugly things, such as blown gaskets, warped cylinder heads and damage to your water pump and radiator. If the temperature gauge creeps upward, don&#8217;t ignore the warnings &#8211; have your coolant checked out before your system reaches its boiling point.</p>
+<p>For coolant exchange or replacement, <a href="/appointment/">schedule an appointment today</a>.</p>
+<h3>How does coolant&#47;antifreeze break down&#63;</h3>
+<p>Time and miles &#8211; it&#8217;s a simple equation. When they&#8217;re at the top of their game, the additives in coolant&#47;antifreeze provide protection, inhibiting corrosion &#40;rust&#41; and scale formation in your car&#8217;s radiator and engine. Over time, these additives get depleted, and the solution becomes less alkaline, leaving your car vulnerable to costly repairs and even engine failure.</p>
+<p>Conventional coolant&#47;antifreeze has the shortest life, but it&#8217;s important to remember not all vehicles are compatible with &#8220;long life&#8221; or &#8220;extended life&#8221; antifreezes. All coolants, through normal operation, eventually become dirtied and contaminated with debris from your engine&#8217;s cooling system. When this happens, the coolant fails to reduce higher temps during hot weather and increase temps during freezing weather. It can also lead to a rust&#45;clogged radiator and heater. What&#8217;s more&#58; the inability to regulate temperature in your engine badly affects other car parts, such as head gaskets, cylinder blocks and o&#45;rings.</p>
+<p><strong>Quick Fact&#58;</strong> Both the American Automobile Association and U.S. Department of Transportation note the majority of roadside breakdowns can be attributed to cooling system failures.</p>
+<p><a href="/appointment/">Schedule a coolant exchange. Right now.</a></p>
+<h3>Can bad things happen if my ride has low or weak coolant&#63;</h3>
+<p>If your engine overheats due to inefficient coolant, dangerous conditions can ensue. Your engine can seize up, crack and stop while your car is in motion. The same holds true during colder weather, when your engine is subject to freeze damage. Scary stuff. This is not an area you want to neglect.</p>
+<h3>What might indicate that my engine&#8217;s coolant needs exchanging or inspection&#63;</h3>
+<p>Significant coolant problem indicators&#58;</p>
+<ul>
+    <li><strong>Low coolant levels&#58;</strong> If your coolant is low, you could have a leak in your cooling system. You may be able to see the leak under your vehicle, and you may be able to smell it as well. If you notice this, get your coolant inspected at the soonest opportunity. Other potential leak culprits include a bad radiator cap, blocked radiator or damaged sensor.</li>
+    <li><strong>Discolored coolant&#58;</strong> Coolant color should never change, but it can when coolant gets contaminated with debris or it&#8217;s been in your car so long that the additives in it deplete. When coolant color changes or gets cloudy, bring it to us to see if it needs to be changed.</li>
+    <li><strong>Engine overheats&#58;</strong> Worst&#45;case scenario&#58; your engine can overheat, seize&#45;up and crack, causing your car to stop completely. If this has happened, it&#8217;s probably too late for a fluid exchange &#8212; you may need a whole engine exchange.</li>
+</ul>
+<p>It&#8217;s a cool time for a coolant exchange. <a href="/appointment/">Schedule an appointment</a>.</p>
+<h3>Are there different types of coolant, and is one &#8220;better&#8221; than another&#63;</h3>
+<p>There are currently three popular coolant types. But most every coolant on the market today contains the same main active cooling ingredient&#58; ethylene glycol. Water and dye are other common ingredients that are consistent among coolant types. The main differences are in the specially formulated additives.</p>
+<ul>
+    <li><strong>Conventional green coolant&#47;antifreeze.</strong> The most basic coolant also has the shortest life span. These conventional formulas typically have anti&#45;corrosion additives that provide extra corrosion protection. However, these additives deplete over time, requiring coolant to be replaced about every two years, 24,000 miles or as recommended by your manufacturer. Read your owner&#8217;s manual since some manufacturers even set 15,000&#45;mile intervals.</li>
+    <li><strong>Dexcool&trade; coolants provide extended coolant life.</strong> There are a variety of Dexcool&trade; formulas, but they all contain long life organic acid technology &#40;OAT&#41; additives that protect your system from corrosion longer. Dexcool&trade; will also be able to remain in your system over a longer period of time, sometimes for as far as 150,000 miles. See your owner&#8217;s manual for more information regarding the coolant type in your vehicle.</li>
+    <li><strong>Hybrid <abbr title="Organic Acid Technology">OAT</abbr> antifreezes and coolants.</strong> We&#8217;re talking about the newer hybrid coolants not hybrid cars. These hybrid coolants go in regular cars and can give your ride a fast&#45;acting formula that may last for an epoch &#40;up to 150,000 miles&#41;. If your vehicle manufacturer specifies that your vehicle is not OAT compatible, a hybrid OAT may be the solution to this problem. Hybrid OAT coolants and antifreezes were designed to solve this coolant compatibility issue. Before using this coolant type, read the label to verify it meets your manufacturer&#8217;s standard.</li>

+<h3>How can we differ from a &#8220;drain and fill&#8221; coolant service&#63;</h3>
+<p>We offer a &#8220;drain and fill&#8221; solution if that is the service you ask for. While drain and fills can work well, they can also leave a considerable amount of old, dirty fluid in the system. This can rob your coolant system of the vital cleaning that&#8217;s necessary for optimal performance. A more comprehensive coolant system cleaning is the old&#45;to&#45;new coolant fluid exchange, where we flush out the old coolant with our flush machine and then put new coolant in.</p>
+<h2>Transmission Fluid Exchange</h2>
+<h3>What is the best day to get a fluid exchange&#63;</h3>
+<p>So, you want to know the industry&#8217;s best kept secret, eh&#63; Well, from our experience, Tuesdays and Wednesdays are usually the best days to stop into Firestone Complete Auto Care. Now that we&#8217;ve said that, we can&#8217;t guarantee those will not become the most popular days as a result. But you asked. And now the cat is out of the bag. See you Tuesday or Wednesday.</p>
+<p>We even have extended evening hours and most stores are open Sundays. <a href="/appointment/">Schedule an oil change</a> for any day of the week.</p>
+<h3>What is transmission fluid&#63;</h3>
+<p>It&#8217;s your transmission&#8217;s lifeline, enabling your vehicle to seamlessly shift gears without tearing them to shreds. Transmission fluid is a unique, hydraulic&#45;powered liquid that&#8217;s designed to cool and lubricate your transmission&#8217;s internal parts so each gear shift feels silky smooth. This fluid ultimately helps preserve the life of the transmission system. Yeah, it&#8217;s that crucial.</p>
+<h3>Do you service transmission fluid exchanges for both automatic and manual transmission, and what&#8217;s the difference&#63;</h3>
+<p>We perform fluid exchanges for both types of transmissions.</p>
+<p>The main thing you need to know&#58; automatic transmissions usually require more frequent fluid exchanges because their systems generate more friction than manual transmissions. Manual transmissions can go a while longer before a fluid exchange because they have fewer moving parts and aren&#8217;t designed as intricately as automatics. Automatics feature a more complex design.</p>
+<p>Of course, it&#8217;s always wise to check your owner&#8217;s manual for interval information. Or check your make and model interval here, on our <a href="/maintenance/schedule.jsp">scheduled maintenance page</a>.</p>
+<p><strong>Quick Tip&#58;</strong> Many manual transmissions use the same fluid as automatics, while other use gear oil. See us or refer to your owner&#8217;s manual to learn about which fluid is right for your ride.</p>
+<h3>How are manual and automatic transmissions built differently&#63;</h3>
+<p>Each transmission is built differently and requires different maintenance intervals, generally speaking.</p>
+<p>Automatic and manual transmissions differ in terms of how they transfer power from the engine&#58; manual transmissions use a clutch, while automatic transmissions employ a torque converter, a device that uses oil flow to transfer power. Manual transmissions involve the meshing and un&#45;meshing of gears with each manual gear shift, while automatic transmissions are a controlled changing of gears that happens automatically without a human operator.</p>
+<p>Generally speaking, automatic transmission fluid needs to be replaced more frequently than manual transmission fluid. This is because the system is more intricate and depends more on fluid to help change gears automatically.</p>
+<h3>Why is a transmission fluid exchange so important&#63;</h3>
+<p>Your system requires a transmission fluid exchange to avoid the damaging effects old fluid can have on your transmission.</p>
+<p>Transmission fluid contains important additives, and those additives wear out over time. The additives provide the transmission and its gears with proper lubrication, keeping harmful debris out, while ensuring the system stays cool. Once the additives deplete, debris is free to float around and wreak havoc. <strong>Debris, compromises lubrication and cooling, and that has the potential to destroy your transmission</strong>.</p>
+<p>Don&#8217;t delay a transmission fluid exchange &#8211; especially if you don&#8217;t remember the last time you had one.</p>
+<p>Protect your gears. <a href="/appointment/">Schedule a transmission fluid exchange today</a>.</p>
+<h3>How often should I have a transmission fluid exchange&#63;</h3>
+<p>The good news is you don&#8217;t have to change transmission fluid as often as motor oil. Change intervals vary by make and model and whether you have automatic or manual transmission. It&#8217;s generally recommended you get your transmission fluid exchanged every 24,000 to 36,000 miles or every two&#45;to&#45;three years &#8211; whichever comes first. It&#8217;s important to note, though, that some new car manufacturers recommend exchanging transmission fluid every 15,000 or even 100,000 miles. Some systems even feature sealed systems, which require no transmission exchange at all.</p>
+<p>At Firestone Complete Auto Care, we follow your vehicle manufacturers&#8217; recommended service intervals when performing a transmission fluid exchange service. You can find the recommended maintenance intervals for fluid replacement in your owner&#8217;s manual or right here on our website.</p>
+<p><a href="/maintenance/schedule.jsp">Discover your vehicle&#8217;s recommended maintenance intervals</a>.</p>
+<h3>What is the benefit of having a transmission fluid exchange performed&#63;</h3>
+<p>An exchange prevents your transmission from slipping due to wear and tear &#8211; and it helps prevent your vehicle from not moving at all.</p>
+<p>By having your old transmission fluid exchanged with new fluid, you&#8217;ll be back to driving with a clean, smooth&#45;shifting and replenished transmission system. You may experience what feels like a night&#45;and&#45;day change, since replenishing your system with friction&#45;modifying additives means gears shift more smoothly.</p>
+<p>Discover the power a transmission fluid exchange can have on your driving experience. <a href="/appointment/">Schedule an appointment today</a>.</p>
+<h3>Should I get a transmission fluid exchange on a car with high miles&#63;</h3>
+<p>There are two schools of thought regarding a transmission fluid exchange on a high&#45;mileage vehicle. Some experts believe that it is not a good idea to exchange transmission fluid when a vehicle&#8217;s transmission is operating properly on a car with high miles. This thinking stems from the idea that the fresh additive package in new fluid removes varnish and deposits that &#8220;hold things together.&#8221; Other experts feel new fluid with fresh additives may be all the transmission needs to return to a properly operational state when the transmission in a high&#45;mileage vehicle is not shifting or operating correctly.</p>
+<p>Given a transmission fluid exchange costs far less than it does to replace or rebuild a car&#8217;s transmission, we believe servicing your transmission at the intervals specified in your owner&#8217;s manual is a prudent investment, one that can prevent significant, costly damage down the line. Exchanging transmission fluid does not cause problems that don&#8217;t already exist.</p>
+<h3>How does transmission fluid break down, and what happens when it does&#63;</h3>
+<p>Just like motor oil, transmission fluid experiences breakdown from normal wear and tear.</p>
+<p>When a car&#8217;s transmission shifts gears, it causes friction. This, in turn, generates heat, and that heat must be carried away by the fluid. The heftier the load on the transmission, the more heat it generates and the hotter the fluid becomes. The hotter the fluid runs, the more quickly it experiences breakdown and the shorter its lifespan. When this happens, the fluid&#8217;s ability to lubricate vital parts is diminished.</p>
+<p>Adding insult to injury, heat generated from the transmission&#8217;s mechanics causes debris from the gears, bearings and friction plates inside the transmission to compromise the quality of the fluid.</p>
+<p>Transmission fluid contains additives to produce oxidation stability, reduce foaming and inhibit corrosion; these, too, can take a turn for the worse over time.</p>
+<p>Changing the fluid at regular intervals is the only way to remove the impurities, boost the benefits of additives and keep your car running smoothly. Properly maintained transmission fluid cools and lubricates the moving parts, enabling hydraulics and gears to transfer power from your engine to your wheels. Now, that&#8217;s an important job.</p>
+<p>Never wait for symptoms of transmission fluid breakdown to progress.</p>
+<p>Protect your gears. <a href="/appointment/">Schedule a transmission fluid exchange today</a>.</p>
+<h3>What symptoms may indicate my transmission fluid is breaking down&#63;</h3>
+<p>Few signs indicate there&#8217;s a problem with your transmission fluid &#8211; until it&#8217;s too late.</p>
+<p><strong>Automatic transmission&#58;</strong> A normally smooth ride may feel sluggish when shifting gears or the time it takes to shift gears may be prolonged. This is usually a sign that your transmission fluid is no longer coating your transmission parts.</p>
+<p><strong>Manual transmission&#58;</strong> &#8220;Clunking,&#8221; &#8220;clashing&#8221; or waiting for your transmission to &#8220;catch&#8221; are red flags. Unfortunately, by then, damage has likely occurred.</p>
+<p>If any of these symptoms crop up, do not ignore them. Have us inspect your ride as soon as possible in order to minimize damage to your vehicle.</p>
+<p><strong>Quick tip&#58;</strong> Please check your owner&#8217;s manual for recommended transmission fluid inspections and for the location of the transmission dipstick. If your transmission has a sealed system, there won&#8217;t be a dipstick &#8211; or a way, for that matter, to inspect fluid on your own. Either way, we can check your transmission fluid levels.</p>
+<p>Need your transmission fluid inspected or exchanged&#63; <a href="/appointment/">Schedule an appointment today</a>.</p>
+<h3>What are the other ways to tell your transmission fluid is old&#63;</h3>
+<p>Your transmission dipstick can also tell the story about your transmission fluid condition.</p>
+<ul>
+    <li><strong>The color&#58;</strong> Automatic transmission fluid should be translucent and/or red in color. Meanwhile, healthy manual transmission fluid may appear red, dark green, blackened or even translucent. If your transmission fluid looks cloudy, or has a dark or brownish tinge, it might be time for a fluid exchange.</li>
+    <li><strong>Burning odor&#58;</strong> If your transmission fluid has a burned smell, it&#8217;s time for new transmission fluid.</li>
+    <li><strong>Low fluid levels&#58;</strong> Though it may help to do a transmission fluid exchange if your transmission fluid dips below a safe level, it&#8217;s really time for a transmission inspection since you shouldn&#8217;t be losing fluid.</li>
+</ul>
+<h3>What are the different types of transmission fluid&#63;</h3>
+<p>There are many types of transmission fluid, and they&#8217;re designed for specific transmissions and vehicle types. Inconvenient as it may be, there isn&#8217;t a one&#45;kind&#45;fits&#45;all transmission fluid for vehicles. Because using the wrong fluid can have damaging effects, take your car to us when you&#8217;re unsure. We stock most major brands of kinds of transmission fluid; if we don&#8217;t have your brand, we&#8217;ll get the fluid your car requires.</p>

+<h2>Fuel System Cleaning</h2>
+<h3>What does a fuel injector do&#63;</h3>
+<p>Talk about important. A fuel injector is crucial to making your engine and car GO. It takes fuel from the fuel pump and breaks it into incredibly small droplets that easily mix with air to allow a more complete internal combustion in the engine. Designed and calibrated for the vehicle it handles, a fuel injector makes sure the fuel can be burned more easily and completely.</p>
+<h3>What causes a fuel system to become &#8220;dirty&#63;&#8221;</h3>
+<p>Fuel injectors can experience reduced flow from accumulated varnish and fuel deposits that form after you turn your car off. Technicians call this &#8220;heat soak.&#8221; What is &#8220;heat soak,&#8221; you ask&#63; Well, when you shut off your ride, some fuel remains by the fuel injector. The heat that&#8217;s still present can burn off the remaining fuel, leaving behind a coat of varnish and fuel deposits. Drive with a compromised fuel injector and you may notice the possible effects before long&#58; sluggish engine performance, an improper air&#45;fuel mix and a marked difference in rough idle and <abbr title="miles per gallon">MPGs</abbr>.</p>
+<p>Separate of that, a car&#8217;s fuel system can also be impacted by gas quality. Because gas tanks are located underground at gas stations, their contents tend to pick up contaminants. These small amounts of debris add up over time, dirtying your fuel system.</p>
+<p><strong>Quick fact&#58;</strong> Keeping your fuel injector clean can maximize the performance of your car and lead to improved acceleration and a reduction in harmful emissions. It also may save you some money at the pump.</p>
+<p>Not sure if your fuel system needs a cleaning&#63; <a href="/appointment/">We&#8217;d be happy to take a look</a>.</p>
+<h3>What&#8217;s the benefit of a fuel system cleaning&#63;</h3>
+<p>Here are a couple potential reasons you might want to get your fuel system cleaned&#58; optimal performance and increased MPGs.</p>
+<p><strong>A fuel system cleaning may be crucial</strong> to remove varnish and deposit build&#45;up in your fuel injector. These build&#45;ups may reduce the proper flow of fuel to your engine, potentially robbing you of MPGs and driving performance. However, it&#8217;s important to note that while some vehicles benefit greatly from this service, others are not as sensitive to the problem. It depends largely on your vehicle&#8217;s system design.</p>
+<p>Ease some pain at the pump. <a href="/appointment/">Get a fuel system cleaning</a>.</p>
+<h3>What are symptoms that show my ride might need a fuel system cleaning&#63;</h3>
+<p>Congratulations. By clicking on this question, you are on the road to better fuel economy and optimal engine performance. In order to detect a dirty fuel system, it&#8217;s important to notice the clear signs that your fuel injector needs a professional, performance&#45;enhancing, cleanse.</p>
+<p><strong>Have your fuel system cleaned if you notice these symptoms&#58;</strong></p>
+<p><strong>A sputtering, sluggish engine.</strong> When you&#8217;re driving along, and you start to accelerate from one gear to the next, you may feel your car accelerating in an atypical or sporadic fashion. This could mean your fuel injector flow is reduced. It also may mean you&#8217;re burning more gas and paying more at the pump.</p>
+<p><strong>More frequent trips to the gas station.</strong> Just because you&#8217;ve had your car for a while doesn&#8217;t mean you should be filling up more often. A vehicle&#8217;s age may lead to a decrease in fuel efficiency and can be attributed to a dirty fuel system. If the fuel injector gets dirty, it can&#8217;t break the fuel down into the incredibly small droplets that allow complete combustion. This can make your engine burn more fuel and less power than it should.</p>
+<p>Worst case scenario, dirt can prevent the injector from closing when it needs to, causing fuel leakage and drop in fuel economy and power.</p>
+<p>Get your ride performing like new again with a fuel system cleaning. <a href="/appointment/">Schedule an appointment</a>.</p>
+<h3>How often should I have a fuel system cleaning performed on my vehicle&#63;</h3>
+<p>We suggest cleaning your car&#8217;s fuel system annually to prevent performance&#45;robbing symptoms. Or, if your vehicle manufacturer recommends a specific cleaning interval in your owner&#8217;s manual, use that as the benchmark.</p>
+<p>Clean your fuel system and get more miles from your tank of gas. <a href="/appointment/">Schedule an appointment</a>.</p>
+<h3>What is included in a fuel system cleaning service&#63;</h3>
+<p>We utilize a <strong>three&#45;step procedure</strong> designed to maintain the entire fuel intake system and maximize your vehicle&#8217;s economy and operating performance.</p>
+<p><strong>During our fuel system cleaning service, we&#58;</strong></p>
+<ol>
+    <li>Add a premium, high tech formula fuel system cleaner to the fuel tank, designed to clean the fuel system from the gas tank to the exhaust. This concentrated formula is used to dissolve gum, varnish and carbon deposits. Highly effective detergents and additives clean the fuel injectors or carburetor, intake valves and combustion chambers, while removing water from the fuel system. We also lubricate injectors, valves, upper cylinders and rings.</li>
+    <li>Manually clean the throttle body and throttle plate using a specially formulated, triple&#45;action cleaner for effective removal of varnish, carbon, dirt and other contaminants. This lubricates the throttle plate and all moving parts and provides double protection with a corrosion inhibitor and lubricity agent. This works in conjunction with lubricating oil to prevent scoring and deposit build.</li>
+    <li>Feed in a two&#45;stage intake deposit cleaner through the engine. This dissolves gum and varnish deposits from the intake manifold and runners, valves and combustion chambers. Residual cleaner continues to soften hard carbon deposits for more thorough, long lasting cleaning and lubrication. Also helps reduce build&#45;up in the catalytic converter and reduce exhaust emissions.</li>
+    <li>Provide a <strong>12 month&#47;12,000 mile</strong> limited warranty.&#42;</li>

+<![CDATA[<h2>What do spark plugs do&#63;</h2>
+<p>Think of spark plugs as the tiniest bolt of lighting. Small but mighty, the spark of electricity that the plug emits across a small gap creates the ignition for the combustion needed to start your car. By putting the engine&#8217;s pistons in motion, your car can power up, stay powered up and produce a smooth burn of the compressed air&#45;fuel mixture. Mind you, spark plugs like it hot&#58; they withstand extreme heat and pressure within your cylinders and are built to burn off deposits from fuel additives or other contaminants.</p>
+<p>What does it mean for you&#63;</p>
+<p>Well, without a spark, your car won&#8217;t start &#8211; or go anywhere. And because spark plug health is directly linked to engine performance, it stands to reason weak or bad spark plugs lead to problems, be it issues with cold&#45;starting or misfires during acceleration. Besides &#8211; without healthy ones &#8211; your ride can&#8217;t sustain maximum power, and your vehicle can see a drop in fuel economy. Now, nobody wants that.</p>
+<h2>What spark plugs do you install&#63;</h2>
+<p>We install a range of high&#45;quality, quick&#45;starting Bosch spark plugs, so you can get where you need to go &#8211; without delay.</p>
+<p><strong>Bosch Platinum Plus spark plugs</strong>&#58; Made with durable, efficient platinum, these plugs maximize MPGs. Adding appeal, they can perform 25&#37; longer than previous Bosch Platinum spark plug.</p>
+<p><strong>Bosch Iridium spark plugs</strong>&#58; The next generation high&#45;performing plugs, these up the ante on durability, ignite faster and last up to four times longer than their distant copper cousins. Better, more reliable power and acceleration as well as enhanced throttle response are things you can take to the bank.</p>
+<p>It&#8217;s no wonder that professional motor sports, like the Indy 500&trade;&#42;, have come to rely on the superior quality and sophisticated manufacturing of Bosch spark plugs, too. In fact, the last 17 Indy 500 winners all crossed the finish line with Bosch spark plugs intact. Now that&#8217;s quite the track record.</p>

+<h2>How often should spark plugs be replaced on my vehicle&#63;</h2>
+<p>Luckily, spark plugs don&#8217;t require replacement very often and can go years and many miles before replacement is a must.</p>
+<p>Most auto manufacturers suggest having new spark plugs installed about every 30,000 miles; however, spark plug longevity depends on the condition and type of spark plug. Copper plugs, for example, have the shortest life, while plugs made of more advanced and durable materials can provide up to four times the life of a copper spark plug.</p>

+<h2>What happens to a spark plug as it ages&#63;</h2>
+<p>By the time spark plugs reach old age, they&#8217;ve spent thousands of miles enduring abuse and withstanding the most extreme temperatures and conditions to stay intact. That&#8217;s where the importance of spark plug material comes into play. The stronger the material, the more durable and long&#45;lasting the spark plug. Naturally, though, every spark plug undergoes wear and tear, materials aside.</p>
+<p>Spark plugs can&#8217;t last forever, and here&#8217;s why&#58;</p>
+<p><strong>Spark plug deposit buildup</strong>&#58; When deposits form on spark plugs from interaction with the air&#45;fuel mixture, it can lead to pre&#45;ignition of the fuel. That means a jerky and unreliable supply of energy for your car.</p>
+<p><strong>Expanding, harder&#45;to&#45;jump gap</strong>&#58; When a spark plug ignites, it has to travel across a gap of space in order provide the right level of combustion at the right moment. As spark plugs age, this gap widens as a result of extreme temperatures, debris and normal wear and tear. If the gap is too far apart, combustion will be erratic or ineffective.</p>
+<p>We have the right Bosch spark plug to provide just the right spark. <a href="/appointment/">Schedule an appointment</a>.</p>
+<h2>What is the benefit of replacing a spark plug&#63;</h2>
+<p>The primary benefit is knowing your car will start without a hitch. Needless to say, that&#8217;s not all that matters. New spark plugs provide a lot of other performance benefits as well.</p>
+<p>New Bosch spark plugs will lead to&#58;</p>
+<ul>
+    <li><strong>Consistent production of optimal combustion.</strong> Fully functioning spark plugs equate a fully functioning combustion system. Get this operating successfully, and a lot of performance issues you&#8217;re experiencing could be a distant memory.</li>
+    <li><strong>Better fuel economy.</strong> The National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence says misfiring spark plugs can <a href="http://www.ase.com/News---Events/Publications/Car-Care-Articles/It-s-Easy-Being--Green-.aspx" rel="external nofollow">reduce fuel efficiency by 30&#37;</a>. New plugs, when replaced at specified intervals, maximize fuel economy and save some dough.</li>
+    <li><strong>Smooth and energetic starts.</strong> The first time you turn the ignition with a new spark plug can be a eye&#45;opening experience. That old spark plug may have been the reason your car was experiencing those jerky starts.</li>
+    <li><strong>Less harmful emissions.</strong> The Environmental Protection Agency states that regular engine tune&#45;ups &#8211; especially in regard to spark plugs &#8211; not only save gas but also reduce <a href="http://www.epa.gov/air/peg/reduce.html" rel="external nofollow">air pollution</a>. That&#8217;s a win&#45;win.</li>
+</ul>
+<p>Bosch spark plugs are engineered to last.</p>

+<h2>How involved is spark plug replacement service&#63;</h2>
+<p>The complexity of a spark plug exchange varies from straightforward to very involved. Your vehicle must be worked on when the parts are cold, and the amount of time it takes to complete the service varies by make and model. In some cases, it may be necessary to disassemble vehicle parts in order to reach your spark plugs. Plan ahead, because a vehicle drop&#45;off is usually required.</p>
+<h2>What symptoms may indicate my vehicle&#8217;s spark plugs need replacing&#63;</h2>
+<p><strong>The signs of worn spark plugs. Hear it. Feel it. Sense it.</strong></p>
+<ul>
+    <li><strong>Rattling, pinging or &#8220;knock&#8221;&#45;like noises.</strong> When spark plugs begin to misfire, you may notice unusual noises from the force of the pistons and combustion not working properly. Pistons travel at high velocities. If the spark plug fires at the wrong time, this could lead to constant rattling, pinging or knocking sounds.</li>
+    <li><strong>Hard vehicle start.</strong> If your car is having trouble starting or just feels disjointed and jerky, your spark plugs may not be working right, and this can lead to misfires and erratic performance.</li>
+    <li><strong>Reduced performance.</strong> When you&#8217;re out cruising, your spark plugs fire when you accelerate and change gears. If the spark that this little plug generates isn&#8217;t functioning at 100 percent, your vehicle performance will be poor, and you&#8217;ll experience a sluggish and fuel&#45;wasting drive.</li>
+    <li><strong>Poor fuel economy.</strong> Lots of things can lead to poor fuel economy, though when it comes to old spark plugs, you&#8217;ll find fuel is wasted since your vehicle fails to receive the proper, heat&#45;generating spark at the right time.</li>
+</ul>
+<p>If you&#8217;ve spotted any of these symptoms, we suggest having your vehicle inspected in order to prevent further problems. Healthy spark plugs are vital to your car&#8217;s ability to start up and remain powered.</p>

+<![CDATA[<h2>How does the A&#47;C system work&#63;</h2>
+<p>We all want the ultimate chill blasting out of our vents; especially when it comes to surviving the hot concrete jungle. When the A&#47;C system kicks in on those hot, sweaty days, that&#8217;s something we all relish. But, believe it or not, there&#8217;s no ice machine inside &#40;but at one time ice was used to cool people&#8217;s rides down&#41;. In fact, the cold air generated by your A&#47;C system is actually hot air with hot gases removed during a multi&#45;step process.</p>
+<p>It really is thermodynamics but we&#8217;re not gonna go there. The Cliff&#8217;s note version is simply about changes in pressure causing changes in temperature. Turn the A&#47;C on and the compressor compresses the system&#8217;s refrigerant &#40;Freon&#41; raising its temperature. It loses heat as it flows through the condenser &#40;that second radiator looking thing in front of the radiator&#41;. It passes through the receiver&#47;dryer where contaminants and moisture are removed, and then on to the expansion valve&#47;accumulator where the refrigerant is slowed down further, causing it to lose pressure and temperature before it gets to the evaporator. The evaporator is like a mini radiator &#40;not to be confused with the heater core &#8212; they are two separate things&#41; inside the dash of your ride that gets cold as it further lowers the refrigerants temperature and, additionally, removes moisture from the air. The ventilation system&#8217;s blower motor blows air over the cold evaporator and pushes cool air into the passenger compartment. Complicated, but aaaaaaaaah is it refreshing&#33;</p>
+<p>Now that you know what being cool is all about, if you have problems being cool, <a href="/appointment/">set up an appointment</a> at Firestone Complete Auto Care for an A&#47;C Performance Check.</p>
+<h2>How often should my A&#47;C be inspected&#63;</h2>
+<p>You tell us. How&#8217;s the air feeling in your ride&#63; Are you refreshed and cooled with full air flow when your A&#47;C is pumping&#63; Well, if you answered &#8220;<q>Yes, I am as cool as a cucumber,</q>&#8221; you can cross A&#47;C inspection off your list.</p>
+<p><strong>For all the &#8220;<q>No</q>&#8221; respondents</strong>&#58; do you fall into the &#8220;<q>my A&#47;C is not cold enough</q>&#8221; or the &#8220;<q>it&#8217;s taking way too long to cool down,</q>&#8221; side of the spectrum&#63; Don&#8217;t sweat, stop in for an A&#47;C Performance Check and we&#8217;ll have you back rolling down those hot summer streets cooler than ever. So chill, your A&#47;C is only an inspection away from cooler days.</p>
+<h2>How often do I need my A&#47;C system &#8220;<q>recharged</q>&#8221;&#63;</h2>
+<p>Only when the cool breeze no longer feels as chilly as you remember. Simple enough. Now, it is true that a well maintained A&#47;C system can go its entire life without needing a recharge. But, that&#8217;s if you&#8217;re extremely lucky.</p>
+<p>If you start noticing your A&#47;C isn&#8217;t reaching those refreshingly cool temperatures, have your system inspected. In this situation, most cars will be low on Freon. And since the A&#47;C is a sealed system, low Freon is a big sign that something is not right. It could be a small leak that needs attention or possibly part of the A&#47;C is failing &#8211; bring it in and we&#8217;ll perform an A&#47;C Performance Check and get to the root of the problem.  We&#8217;ll get you back out there cruising with a nice, cool breeze again.</p>
+<h2>What is refrigerant&#63;</h2>
+<p>Typically referred to by the DuPont trade name Freon, the most common Freons are R&#45;12, R&#45;134A, and soon, HFO&#45;1234yf. Freon is pretty similar to motor oil and radiator coolant in that it is a working fluid designed for a specific system; In this case, your car&#8217;s A&#47;C system.</p>
+<p>Refrigerant is a specially formulated mixture that&#8217;s sole purpose for transforming hot air into cold air. It does this by absorbing and releasing heat, ultimately leaving cool air behind.</p>
+<p>Different devices, such as the home refrigerator, home A&#47;C system or your vehicle may use different types of refrigerants. They may or may not be the same. Now that you know what cools down cars, homes and meat lockers, crank that baby up and marvel as your A&#47;C turns stale hot air into your own personal ice box.</p>
+<h2>What exactly is Freon&#63;</h2>
+<p>Sounds like an automotive A&#47;C history class is in order. Well, welcome, pull up a chair and put on your thinking cap.</p>
+<p><strong>Freon, better known as R&#45;12</strong>, was the primary chlorofluorocarbon &#40;<abbr title="Chlorofluorocarbons">CFC</abbr>&#41; used in car A&#47;C systems up until it was banned in the mid 1990s after the <abbr title="Environmental Protection Agency">EPA</abbr>  discovered that it was depleting our planet&#8217;s ozone Layer. Talk about toxic.</p>
+<p><strong>The auto industry has since switched to the CFC free R&#45;134a</strong>. Since the elimination of CFCs from the auto industry &#8212;and all industries for that matter&#8212;the ozone layer has regained its structure, and the ozone holes caused by CFCs are expected to fully close by about 2050 according to the EPA.</p>
+<p><strong>Did you know&#63;</strong> The CFC ban thankfully also marked the end of the CFC heavy hairspray craze that swept the nation in the 70s and 80s. For many people, this change was a welcomed advancement in American hair culture.</p>
+<h2>What is the Montreal Protocol&#63; &#40;R&#45;12&#41;</h2>
+<p>No, this isn&#8217;t a treaty you learned about in history class. The Montreal Protocol is actually the official title of the banishment of R&#45;12 &#40;Freon&#41; and other CFC &#40;Chlorofluorocarbons&#41; emitting products from further use anywhere on the planet. And for good reason&#8212;CFCs were discovered to be tearing big holes in our ozone layer.</p>
+<p>The Montreal Protocol was first signed into law in 1987. If the entire industrial world follows the environmental standards meant to eliminate the use of ozone depleting gases &#40;in place in the United States since 1996&#41;, the ozone is said to fully recover by 2050.</p>
+<p>The Montreal Protocol is why we now use R&#45;134a instead of the ozone depleting R&#45;12. Starting in 2013, certain U.S. vehicle models will begin transitioning to an even more efficient and safer cooling agent called HFO&#45;1234yf. Talk about a mouthful. HFO&#45;1234yf is said to have almost no environmental impact what&#45;so&#45;ever. And that&#8217;s something we can all look forward to.</p>
+<h2>What&#8217;s the difference between R&#45;134a and R&#45;12&#63;</h2>
+<p>You can say the difference is so big that it has spared the fate of the entire planet. Not to get all deep on your psyche and all, but after it was discovered that R&#45;12 and a whole multitude of products containing Chlorofluorocarbons &#40;CFC&#41; were  destroying the ozone layer, environmental scientists immediately started work on an alternative cooling agents free of ozone depleting CFCs. That formula is R&#45;134a&#58; <strong>the standard and only refrigerant permitted in automotive A&#47;C systems today</strong>.</p>
+<p><strong>R&#45;134a, though safer, is not perfect&#58;</strong></p>
+<p>Beginning in 2013, R&#45;134a is being replaced by a new formula, HFO&#45;1234yf, available on select U.S. car models. HFO&#45;1234yf is the cleanest, safest refrigerant yet. And what&#8217;s even more important is that it has been studied and certified as leaving no impact on the environment what&#45;so&#45;ever. Talk about a great advancement in A&#47;C technology that will help protect our planet for all those driven to cruise the open roads for many years to come.</p>
+<h2>But why replace R&#45;134a&#63;</h2>
+<p>Well, although R&#45;134a was designed with the ozone layer in mind, it&#8217;s still made with chemicals that can harm the environment if they leak out of your A&#47;C system or are disposed of improperly. With that known fact, international environmental scientists knew an even safer A&#47;C refrigerant was out there waiting to be formulated.</p>
+<p><strong>HFO&#45;1234yf is set to become the refrigerant standard&#58; </strong></p>
+<ul>
+    <li>It has been tested and found to leave behind virtually no impact on the environment.</li>
+    <li>If your A&#47;C system should leak, there&#8217;s no longer an environmental freak out.</li>
+</ul>
+<p>It&#8217;s all about the future generations of drivers. Our goal as automotive professionals is to provide the best care for your car while preserving the natural environment of the road your vehicle cruises down for many years to come.</p>
+<h2>How many parts make up a car A&#47;C system&#63;</h2>
+<p>Your A&#47;C system consists of five major parts, all working together to cool you off and all your passengers.</p>
+<p><strong>Most A&#47;C systems are built with&#58;</strong></p>
+<ul>
+    <li>Compressor</li>
+    <li>Condenser</li>
+    <li>Receiver dryer or Accumulator</li>
+    <li>Orifice tube or Expansion valve</li>
+    <li>Evaporator</li>
+</ul>
+<p>Your A&#47;C system also consists of hoses and refrigerant charging ports, but the significant work occurs in the five parts listed above. You can learn more about each part that makes up your A&#47;C system starting with the next question. Cool.</p>
+<h2>What is the A&#47;C compressor&#63;</h2>
+<p>The compressor is the core, primary part of every A&#47;C system. If you want to stay cool, a working compressor is essential. We&#8217;ve seen people try to create cold air with out one. Trust us, it doesn&#8217;t work.</p>
+<p><strong>The compressor&#58;</strong></p>
+<ul>
+    <li>Pressurizes the refrigerant that cools your air.</li>
+    <li>Senses temperature changes&#58; Compressors monitor and control temperature output with an electrically operated clutch. This clutch turns on and off whenever you change the temperature, choose a different airflow setting or just when plain old air from outside drops or rises in temperature.</li>
+    <li>Powered by the serpentine belt&#58; That winding belt under your hood is responsible for powering many crucial components, including your A&#47;C compressor.</li>
+</ul>
+<p><strong>Signs of a worn compressor&#58;</strong> Oil or Freon leaks, noise, and erratic or no operation are indications that a compressor may need to be replaced. We can inspect your car for leaks using special refrigerant detecting dyes and devices. You may not be able to see a leak, but our equipment, sometimes referred to as a &#8220;<q>sniffer,</q>&#8221; can detect&#8212;or sniff&#45;out&#8212;a chemical leak even if no liquid is visible. Yea, you can say we&#8217;re pretty advanced over here.</p>
+<h2>What is an A&#47;C condenser&#63;</h2>
+<p>Consider it the master of turning hot refrigerant gasses into liquid. The condenser is mounted at the front of most vehicles, usually in front of the radiator. Air passes through the condenser, turning the hot refrigerant gas into a condensed, cooler refrigerant liquid.</p>
+<p><strong>An A&#47;C condenser is&#58;</strong></p>
+<ul>
+    <li>Found In front of the radiator and often referred to as a mini&#45;radiator</li>
+    <li>The master refrigerant cooler. And still champion. The Condenser radiates the hot refrigerant gasses that have entered from the compressor, reducing its temperature and pressure, turning it into a liquid that moves on to the A&#47;C Dryer.</li>
+</ul>
+<p><strong>Signs of a worn condenser&#58;</strong></p>
+<ul>
+    <li>Leaks</li>
+    <li>Clogged, corroded or damaged fins or tubes</li>
+    <li>Poor air conditioning performance</li>
+</ul>
+<h2>What&#8217;s a receiver&#47;dryer&#63;</h2>
+<p>The receiver or dryer is found on vehicles with a thermal expansion valve. It&#8217;s the safety net responsible for trapping all harmful debris, moisture and liquids from reaching the compressor and other vital A&#47;C parts.</p>
+<p><strong>The roles of the receiver&#47;dryer&#58;</strong> </p>
+<ol type="1">
+    <li>Separates gas from liquid. If liquid isn&#8217;t contained in the dryer, it can enter and destroy your compressor &#40;Compressors aren&#8217;t designed to handle liquids. Only gas&#41;.</li>
+    <li>Removes moisture. To trap moisture, a desiccant is used. Desiccant is similar to those moisture killing packets you find in the packaging of new electronic devices.</li>
+    <li>Filters out contaminants. No one wants a contaminated A&#47;C system. Contaminants can lead to accelerated parts wear and damaging corrosion.</li>
+</ol>
+<p><strong>Quick fact&#58;</strong> If there&#8217;s any moisture present in your compressor, it can mix with the Refrigerant and create very damaging corrosive acids.</p>
+<p><strong>Symptoms of a worn receiver&#47;dryer&#58;</strong></p>
+<ul>
+    <li>Poor air conditioner performance</li>
+    <li>Moisture on glass and&#47;or inability of defroster to remove moisture from glass and windows</li>
+</ul>
+<p><strong>The receiver&#47;dryer must be replaced in the following situations&#58;</strong></p>
+<ul>
+    <li>Anytime the A&#47;C system is opened for repair, the reciever/dryer will need to be replaced.</li>
+    <li>Whenever a technician has determined moisture or debris has permanently damaged your receiver&#47;dryer performance.</li>
+</ul>
+<h2>What is an accumulator&#63;</h2>
+<p>An accumulator is similar to a receiver&#45;dryer but only found on vehicles with an orifice tube. If you have an accumulator, that means you don&#8217;t have a thermal expansion valve.</p>
+<p><strong>The accumulator&#58;</strong></p>
+<ul>
+    <li><strong>Monitors and controls</strong> the amount of refrigerant that enters the evaporator.</li>
+    <li><strong>Stores excess Refrigerant</strong> so that it cannot enter and damage the compressor.</li>
+    <li><strong>Filters debris and removes</strong> moisture from the A&#47;C System.</li>
+</ul>
+<p><strong>When to replace the accumulator&#58;</strong></p>
+<ul>
+    <li>Anytime the A&#47;C system is opened for repair, the accumulator will need to be replaced.</li>
+    <li>Whenever a technician has determined moisture or debris has permanently damaged your accumulator&#8217;s performance.</li>
+</ul>
+<h2>What is a thermal expansion valve&#47;orifice tube&#63;</h2>
+<p>The orifice tube or thermal expansion valve is located between the condenser and the evaporator. Its job is to constantly monitor the pressure and temperature of you&#8217;re A&#47;C system in order to determine the exact amount of refrigerant that can safely enter your evaporator. An orifice tube may also contain a fine mesh screen to block contaminants from the rest of the system.</p>
+<p><strong>Quick fact&#58;</strong> If too much or too little refrigerant enters the evaporator, you could have a big problem on your hands. The proper function of the thermal expansion valve or orifice tube is crucial for successful  A&#47;C system operation.</p>
+<p><strong>Signs of a worn orifice tube or thermal expansion valve&#58;</strong></p>
+<ul>
+    <li>Poor A&#47;C system performance</li>
+    <li>When a technician has determined it has become dirty or clogged</li>
+</ul>
+<h2>What is an evaporator&#63;</h2>
+<p>The evaporator is responsible for cooling air and removing moisture. If cold, refreshing air is hitting your face, your evaporator is working like a champ.</p>
+<p><strong>The evaporator&#58;</strong></p>
+<ul>
+    <li><strong>Located right behind your dash.</strong> The evaporator is the last and most important stop before cold air can hit your face.</li>
+    <li><strong>Cools air with refrigerant.</strong> Low pressure Refrigerant traveling through the evaporator absorbs heat from the passenger compartment dropping the temperature of the evaporator. Air blown over the cool surface of the evaporator then comes out the vents providing the chill you expect.</li>
+    <li><strong>Commences cold air flow.</strong> The best and final stage. Cold air should now be blowing out your vents thanks to the hard work of the evaporator.</li>
+</ul>
+<p><strong>Symptoms of a worn evaporator&#58;</strong></p>
+<ul>
+    <li>Poor A&#47;C system performance</li>
+</ul>
+<h2>What is a compressor clutch&#63;</h2>
+<p>Before the compressor turns on, a special electro&#45;magnetic clutch, conveniently called the &#8220;<q>compressor clutch,</q>&#8221; is necessary to engage and disengage the compressor cycle. The compressor clutch tells the compressor when to turn on or off so that the Freon &#40;refrigerant&#41; is correctly pressurized for use by the condenser which is then delivered to the evaporator where the chill begins.</p>
+<p>Experiencing A&#47;C problems&#63; <a href="/appointment/">Schedule an A&#47;C Performance Check today</a>.</p>
+<h2>What is the clutch cycling switch&#63;</h2>
+<p>The clutch cycling switch senses and controls the temperature in the evaporator core to prevent it from freezing. Although most cars can blow air at temperatures as low as 60 degrees, the temperatures inside the evaporator core can get cold enough to completely freeze the entire core. Not good&#33; The clutch cycle&#8217;s job is to make sure the evaporator temperature doesn&#8217;t reach the point of glacier temperatures.</p>
+<p><strong>Symptoms of a failing clutch cycling switch&#58;</strong></p>
+<ul>
+    <li>Evaporator freezing up</li>
+    <li>Evaporator does not get cold enough</li>
+</ul>
+<h2>What is a refrigerant charge port&#63;</h2>
+<p>This is where the magic happens. The refrigerant charge port is the connection point where new refrigerant can enter the system during an A&#47;C system recharge. Your port is usually located on the bigger A&#47;C hose near or on the accumulator.</p>
+<p><strong>Caution&#58;</strong> Only properly equipped and qualified persons should perform A&#47;C recharging services.</p>]]>

+<p>If you&#8217;re about to go to bed and want to avoid nightmares, you might want to put off reading this until morning. If you&#8217;re about to get in the car, please read on.</p>
+<p>While Black Death is not the same as the deadly plague during the 14th century, a car <abbr title="air conditioning">A&#47;C</abbr> system experiencing Black Death will be infected like the plague. Black Death starts out inside the compressor after refrigerant breaks down. Since refrigerant acts as a working fluid much like how motor oil is the fluid which provides lubrication to protect the engine, a refrigerant breakdown will result in ugly wear, starting in the compressor. From there, the sharp and grimy metal particles created during compressor breakdown can then travel through the rest of your A&#47;C system, wreaking havoc on the entire system. Before you know it, all cold air, and airflow for that matter, will be long gone. Cue the A&#47;C grim reaper.</p>
+<p>The best protection from Black Death is an A&#47;C Performance Check. <a href="/appointment/">Schedule one today.</a></p>
+<h2>Why does my A&#47;C have weak airflow&#63;</h2>
+<p>We feel your pain and discomfort caused by weak airflow. The sweat alone is enough to drive any of us crazy. However, there are a lot of factors at play. If you notice reduced airflow early on &#8211;rather than later&#8211; take the right step and have it looked at before other fatal A&#47;C system damage can occur.</p>
+<h3>Main causes of weak airflow:</h3>
+<ul>
+ <li>Mold or mildew may have accumulated in the evaporator core from residual moisture that occurs during the cooling process. When this happens, air will have trouble reaching your air vents.</li>
+ <li>A hose has come loose. This usually happens with the blower hose that supplies air to the blower unit.</li>
+ <li>Ventilation fan is fried. If the fan&#8217;s not blowing, air won&#8217;t be flowing very well.</li>
+ <li>Seals. No, not those seals down by the pier. Core case seals, blower house seals or evaporator core case seals; All can open up and diminish air flow. A&#47;C ventilation systems are very sensitive and must remain sealed. Once they&#8217;re opened, the whole system is compromised.</li>
+</ul>
+<p>Whatever&#8217;s the cause of your airflow problems, we have the answer. <a href="/appointment/">Schedule an A&#47;C Performance Check</a>.</p>
+<h2>Are there any system warning lights to alert me to an A&#47;C problem&#63;</h2>
+<p>Typically, no, but some vehicles have Driver Information Centers &#40;<abbr title="Driver Information Centers">DIC</abbr>&#41; that may display the status of many vehicle systems. Refer to your Owner&#8217;s Manual for more information.</p>
+<h2>My A&#47;C isn&#8217;t as cold as it used to be, what&#8217;s going on&#63;</h2>
+<p>There are several reasons an A&#47;C system can lose its cool. Bring your ride to us as soon as you start noticing this symptom, it could mean the difference between needing a small repair, or worse, a large one. Here&#8217;s what can cause your cold air to lose its cool.</p>
+<h3>The lack of precious cold air could be caused by:</h3>
+<ul>
+ <li>A Freon leak caused by a failed o&#45;ring, seal, hose or component</li>
+ <li>A clogged expansion tube or refrigerant charging hose</li>
+ <li>Failed compressor or compressor clutch</li>
+ <li>Failed blower motor or blower motor resistor</li>
+ <li>Damaged or failed condenser or evaporator</li>
+ <li>Vacuum leaks</li>
+ <li>Failed switch, fuse, relay, control module, blend door or solenoid</li>
+</ul>
+<p>
+ Leaks can be devastating. When an A&#47;C system develops a leak, you have what&#8217;s called an &#8220;open system.&#8221; If you or your technician discovers the leak early, your repair will be less expensive. Unfortunately, if a leak has been affecting your cold air for a while, moisture will most likely have entered your A&#47;C system and may have damaged other vital and expensive parts. Stay cool. <a href="/appointment/">Schedule an A&#47;C Performance Check</a>.

+<h2>The A&#47;C starts out cool then starts getting warm, what&#8217;s happening&#63;</h2>
+<p>Well, like many complicated stories, there&#8217;s never one simple answer. A&#47;C systems are a fickle breed. Your best bet is to have us inspect your system for any of the following listed symptoms.</p>
+<h3>From cold to hot and all the symptoms in between:</h3>
+<ul>
+ <li>The clogged expansion valve: The expansion valve distributes the proper amount of refrigerant to your evaporator. If the valve is blocked, the refrigerant can&#8217;t flow into the evaporator. With the valve clogged, the refrigerant will start to freeze the valve altogether if moisture is present.</li>
+ <li>Faulty compressor clutch: If the clutch is not engaging with your compressor, than your compressor can&#8217;t maintain the correct pressure. Hot air will result.</li>
+ <li>The blown fuse scenario: Fuses sometimes short out. If the fuse associated with your A&#47;C system goes, the power to certain parts will stop.</li>
+ <li>Leaks are an A&#47;C system&#8217;s worst friend: Leaks are the result of damage or the presence of moisture. When moisture and refrigerant mix, nasty corrosive acids will eat away at seals and components, causing a leak.</li>
+</ul>
+<h2>What is the smelly, gym locker odor coming from my A&#47;C vents&#63;</h2>
+<p>Sounds like you have an odorific problem on your hands. There are a few issues that may be causing this smell.</p>
+<h3>Potential causes of nasty &#8220;gym locker&#8221; odors:</h3>
+<ul>
+ <li>Dirty and old air cabin filter.</li>
+ <li>Moldy evaporator case. A problem for many vehicles when water sits in the evaporator case because the case&#8217;s drain is blocked. Mold will accumulate.</li>
+</ul>
+<h2>How do you test for an A&#47;C system leak&#63; </h2>
+<p>While we&#8217;re no <abbr title="Crime Scene Investigation">C.S.I.</abbr> unit, the ways to detect an A&#47;C system leak are not far off from an episode of the ever popular investigation show.</p>
+<h3>Detecting leaks:</h3>
+<ul>
+ <li>Black light enabled dyes. You read that right. A lot of refrigerants are pre&#45;mixed with a special <abbr title="ultraviolet">U.V.</abbr> dye that shows up under black light. We&#8217;ll run a black light over your A&#47;C system to see if any dye shows up.</li>
+ <li>Bring in the &#8220;sniffer.&#8221; A sniffer is a special device that hones in on the refrigerant&#8217;s chemical components. If there&#8217;s a leak, our sniffer will sniff it out.</li>
+</ul>
+<h2>What causes an A&#47;C system leak&#63;</h2>
+<p>Age and moisture. Plain and simple. Rubber seals and hoses can also lose their elasticity over time and breakdown allowing Freon to escape and moisture to enter your vehicle&#8217;s A&#47;C system. Moisture is the kiss of death for your A&#47;C system, mixing with refrigerant and creating a system destroying corrosive acid.</p>
+<p>Quick fact: If moisture is present, it could damage your accumulator, receiver or drier. Remember, these devices are responsible for removing moisture from the A&#47;C system and will eventually stop functioning once they are exposed to an open system &#40;leak or crack&#41;.</p>]]>

+<![CDATA[<h2>How does Firestone Complete Auto Care inspect my A&#47;C system&#63;</h2>
+<p>We use a customized machine &#40;<strong>RTI RHS980</strong>&#41; that has been specifically designed to test and diagnose any and all automotive A&#47;C problems. If we suspect a leak we&#8217;ll install a special <abbr title="ultraviolet">UV</abbr> Dye visible by black light or use &#8220;<q>sniffer</q>&#8221; to detect leaks. This device is run along the outside of your A&#47;C system parts and can detect any refrigerant fumes and residue that have breached the A&#47;C system.</p>
+<h2>Do I need an appointment to have my A&#47;C inspected&#63;</h2>
+<p>Stay cool. An appointment isn&#8217;t necessary to provide a comprehensive A&#47;C Performance Check, but a service appointment can be made for your convenience.</p>
+<p><a href="/appointment/">Schedule an A&#47;C Performance Check</a>.</p>
+<h2>How long does an A&#47;C Performance Check take&#63;</h2>
+<p>Well, you&#8217;ve guessed it, most A&#47;C repairs occur during the hottest days of the year. Let&#8217;s just say, when it rains it pours car A&#47;C repairs. And when the weather heats up is usually when most people realize their A&#47;C isn&#8217;t working. The inspection and testing process alone can take at least 30 minutes&#8212;and that&#8217;s if there is no problem or it&#8217;s an easy problem to spot &#40;are you feeling lucky&#63;&#41;.</p>
+<p>In many cases, should any work be required on your A&#47;C system, you&#8217;ll have the convenience of having the recommended services performed that same day. So don&#8217;t sweat it. No additional appointments are necessary. We&#8217;ve all got busy lives. Drop your vehicle off and we&#8217;ll give you a ring when it&#8217;s done so you can get on with your day while your vehicle is getting the full A&#47;C treatment. Want to wait&#63; Pull up a chair in our cozy customer lounge and chill out in our A&#47;C while we fix your A&#47;C.</p>
+<h2>Why do I need A&#47;C in the winter&#63;</h2>
+<p>Because scraping the inside of your windows is even less fun than scraping the outside&#33; Seriously, not only does your air conditioning system provide cool air in the summer, it also de&#45;humidifies the air, eliminating moisture when you&#8217;re running the defroster in the winter. A properly functioning A&#47;C system is especially important in the winter to eliminate moisture that fogs up or freezes on the inside of the glass preventing you from seeing clearly.</p>
+<p>Get rid of your winter A&#47;C frustrations.</p>

+<h2>Do you service A&#47;C systems on Hybrid Vehicles&#63;</h2>
+<p>If your Hybrid is equipped with a standard, belt&#45;driven A&#47;C compressor, then we can service your vehicle.</p>
+<p>Note&#58; <strong>Currently, we do not service Hybrid vehicles with electrically driven A&#47;C compressors.</strong></p>
+<h2>What special equipment do you use when servicing my A&#47;C system&#63;</h2>
+<p>The <strong>RTI RHS980</strong> is the brains behind the complicated equations and chemical analysis performed during an A&#47;C system test. This machine is standard in all our Firestone locations and is the most trusted and accurate way to detect any potential A&#47;C system problems. Without this equipment, a lot of hard to detect problems would either go unnoticed or take a lot longer to detect.</p>
+<h2>How are Firestone technicians trained to service A&#47;C systems&#63;</h2>
+<p>Not any technician off the street can service an A&#47;C system. Really. it&#8217;s the law. Any person that wants to service an A&#47;C system must first receive proper training and pass a certification test conducted by the Mobile Air Conditioning Society &#40;<abbr title="Mobile Air Conditioning Society">MACS</abbr>&#41;.</p>
+<p>MACS was created in 1990 after the <abbr title="Environmental Protection Agency">EPA</abbr> required special certification for any technician servicing any A&#47;C systems. The MACS certification test is designed to gauge the technician&#8217;s knowledge on properly recovering and recycling refrigerant. Refrigerant is a highly volatile and dangerous substance requiring certification by the EPA.</p>
+<p>Although the MACS test is not designed to evaluate the skills necessary to repair or service an A&#47;C system, here at Firestone Complete Auto Care, we go a step further.</p>
+<p>With our own onsite training, our technicians receive the complete training regimen necessary to understand and successfully recharge and repair any car, truck or <abbr title="sport utility vehicle">SUV</abbr> A&#47;C system part.</p>

+<headline><![CDATA[FAQs About Your Car&#8217;s Cabin, Fuel and Air Filters]]></headline>
+<content>
+<![CDATA[<h2>What does an air filter, cabin air filter or fuel filter do&#63;</h2>
+<p>All auto filters are designed to prevent harmful debris from entering any parts where air and fluid flows, including your engine, radiator, fuel lines and more. Once a filter is no longer performing its intended function, decreased performance &#8211; even engine damage &#8211; can result.</p>
+<p>You&#8217;ve been reaping the benefits of filters your entire life. If you&#8217;ve ever used a furnace or air conditioning system at home, you&#8217;ve had to replace a filter from time to time. If you haven&#8217;t, well, you might want to go and check those out too. You can send us a thank you letter later &#8211; if you want.</p>
+<p><strong>In the meantime, here&#8217;s what each automotive filter does&#58;</strong></p>
+<p><strong>Air filter&#58;</strong> Prevents harmful debris, dirt and contaminants from entering your engine.</p>
+<p><strong>Cabin filter&#58;</strong> An implementation that began appearing in vehicles in 2002, it prevents dust, pollen, dirt and other pollutants from entering your car through your A&#47;C and heat vents.</p>
+<p><strong>Fuel Filter&#58;</strong> Keeps dirt, debris and contaminants from clogging your fuel lines and causing erratic, unstable fuel performance and reduced fuel economy.</p>
+<h2>How often should an air, cabin air or fuel filter be replaced&#63;</h2>
+<p>Generally, it&#8217;s recommended that you get your filters replaced every 12 months or 12,000 miles, but check your owner&#8217;s manual for specifics about your vehicle&#8217;s filter replacement schedules.</p>
+<p>Time for a filter replacement&#63; <a href="/appointment/">Schedule an appointment</a>.</p>
+<h2>What happens to air, cabin air or fuel filters as they get older&#63;</h2>
+<p>Any filter &#8211; home, auto or otherwise &#8211; will eventually age and become contaminated with pollutants and debris. When that happens, the filter loses its effectiveness and hinders the performance of the parts it is supposed to protect.</p>
+<p>When your air filter is dirty, your engine is forced to work harder, resulting in poor fuel economy, higher emissions and, possibly, a loss of engine power. In turn, as a worst&#45;case scenario, a clogged cabin air filter can lead to under&#45;performance of the A&#47;C system, causing weak air flow from the cabin vents. It can also lead to unwanted, unfiltered air in the cabin. As for a mucked&#45;up fuel filter, that&#8217;ll land you with a weakened fuel supply to injectors, a reduction in engine power, poor acceleration and lousy fuel economy &#8211; not to mention a potential breakdown.</p>
+<p>Replace old filters to avoid placing stress on other vital car parts.</p>

+<h2>What is the benefit of replacing an air, cabin air or fuel filter&#63;</h2>
+<p>The benefits are car&#45;saving and performance&#45;enhancing. They protect vital car parts by keeping harmful debris at bay so your car runs right. Filters also ensure your car runs more efficiently. The cleaner your filter, the more it allows for the maximum flow of air or fluid through the system. Like a clogged drain, a dirty filter starves the system of the vital air or fluid and makes each system it protects work harder to do its job. Once filters are dirtied, they should be replaced.</p>
+<p><strong>The purpose of each filter is clear&#58; to trap and protect.</strong></p>
+<p>Air filter&#58; Engine protection is the name of the game. So is engine performance. <a href="http://www.osti.gov/bridge" rel="external nofollow">Acceleration can improve up to 11&#37;</a> after an old, dirty air filter is replaced. Our Purolator Classic air filters are engineered to trap 96.5&#37; of harmful contaminants that can damage your engine.&#42;</p>
+<p class="legal">&#42;Based on <abbr title="International Organization for Standardization">ISO</abbr> 5011 on A13192</p>
+<p><span class="block"><strong>Cabin air filter&#58;</strong></span> <strong>Made to prevent outside allergens and dust from entering your ride&#8217;s air vents.</strong> The benefit&#58; it keeps the air that you breathe inside the cabin clean. They&#8217;re engineered to trap a whole bunch of things, including pollen, dust, mold spores, smoke, soot and smog &#8211; none of which belong in your nose.
+</p>
+<p><span class="block"><strong>Fuel filter&#58;</strong></span> <strong>The cleaner the fuel system, the more efficiently your vehicle will operate.</strong> Even a slight reduction in fuel flow can affect your vehicle&#8217;s overall performance and fuel economy. With a new fuel filter, you typically notice a boost in fuel efficiency and overall performance. And with the cost of gas these days, that savings can be significant.
+</p>
+<p>Time for new filters&#63; <a href="/appointment/">Schedule an appointment</a>.</p>
+<h2>What are some symptoms that indicate my vehicle&#8217;s air, cabin air or fuel filter may benefit from a replacement&#63;</h2>
+<p>Once a filter is old and full of crud, you&#8217;ll notice a decline in your vehicle&#8217;s operation. Filters are all about ensuring clean and pure performance. If you see a drop in fuel economy, a decrease in power and performance or notice the A&#47;C and heating system just doesn&#8217;t appear to be working as well, it may be time to replace one or more filters.</p>
+<p><span class="block"><strong>Spot the symptom. Replace the filter.</strong></span> <strong>Air filter&#58;</strong> Old and dirty air filters lead to reduced engine power, decreased throttle response, weaker acceleration and increased engine wear. Sounds ugly. Well, it is, and you should have it replaced when it gets bad.
+</p>
+<p><strong>Cabin air filter&#58;</strong> As time passes, you may notice air flowing through your vents is weaker. This happens when the filter is REALLY mucked&#45;up &#8212; in the worst case. You may also notice that there is a difference in air quality in the cabin when you&#8217;re on the road. This may be the result of unwanted, unfiltered air entering the cabin because the filter is dirty. Hah&#45;choo&#33;</p>
+<p><strong>Fuel filter&#58;</strong> Replace your fuel filter if you start noticing reduced MPGs or sluggish engine performance &#40;sputtering horsepower, dragging&#41;. Avoid these situations by replacing your fuel filter, regularly. If you delay a fuel filter replacement, you could clog a fuel injector completely with dirt or debris, cutting off fuel from the engine and making it stop. Now, that&#8217;s bad news.</p>

+<h2>How long does it take to replace the filters on my vehicle&#63;</h2>
+<p>Times vary, but most filters can be replaced quickly, provided they&#8217;re in an easy&#45;to&#45;reach place. However, more and more of today&#8217;s vehicle manufacturers are placing filters in trickier locations, largely for design and space efficiency purposes. Hard to reach filters ultimately require extra service time when they need replacement. If this is the case, we&#8217;ll keep you informed on how long it will take.</p>
+<p>Hard or easy to access, we&#8217;ll replace your filter and have you on your way as soon as possible.</p>

+<content>
+<![CDATA[<h2>What does a serpentine belt do&#63;</h2>
+<p>Well, it won&#8217;t keep your pants up, but does transport power to your vital automotive components. The serpentine belt is one long, snaking, winding belt that keeps your alternator, power steering pump, air conditioning and &#8212; in some cases &#8212; your water pump running smoothly and effectively.</p>
+<h2>Didn&#8217;t cars used to have more than one belt&#63;</h2>
+<p>Back in the day, cars had individual belts for many components. Though each belt could be replaced individually, these cars experienced inconsistent or compromised performance as individual belts began to wear down. Now that vehicles employ a single belt &#8211; the serpentine belt &#8211; that&#8217;s no longer an issue. That said, it&#8217;s critical that regular inspections are done to make sure the belt is in good shape.</p>
+<h2>How often does a serpentine belt need to be replaced&#63;</h2>
+<p>Serpentine belts are built to last &#8211; much longer than before because of advancements in rubber technology. Under ideal conditions, a belt should stick with you for an average of 60,000 to 100,000 miles. Pretty impressive. However, some belts are manually tensioned and may need to be adjusted. Others have a self&#45;tensioning mechanism that can experience wear over time and may need to be serviced. One thing to remember&#58; in most cases, if the belt breaks, the vehicle will stop running.</p>
+<p>Need your engine belt inspected or replaced&#63; <a href="/appointment/">Schedule an appointment</a>.</p>
+<h2>How many belts do most vehicles have&#63;</h2>
+<p>Today, there&#8217;s one belt to run them all &#8212; well, for the majority of vehicles. It&#8217;s called the serpentine belt. Some rides may have an additional belt to run select accessories, but the serpentine does the bulk of the work. Before this all&#45;in&#45;one serpentine solution, cars were equipped with many different belts to power individual parts and components.</p>
+<p>Get your engine belt inspected or replaced. <a href="/appointment/">Schedule an appointment</a>.</p>
+<h2>What happens as a belt gets older&#63;</h2>
+<p>They can wear, fray, crack or become shiny or &#8220;glazed,&#8221; and rubber parts can peel off the belt. An aging belt can also begin slipping or squealing, become contaminated with fluid or become misaligned, in which case it will need to be replaced. An old belt can even snap, leaving you up the creek; without one, drive torque to all of the engine&#8217;s accessories is lost.</p>

+<h2>What is the benefit of having a belt replaced&#63;</h2>
+<p>Driving on an old belt is a disaster waiting to happen because it powers most all of an engine&#8217;s accessories. That means when your belt breaks, slips and, ultimately, wears out, everything &#8211; from the power steering pump to the alternator and air conditioner &#8211; stops working. What&#8217;s more, the parts it controls can become severely damaged. Broken hoses and belts are bad; a damaged engine is even worse. By replacing your belt periodically, you can minimize the risk of breakdown.</p>
+<p><strong>Make time to have your belt inspected</strong>.</p>
+<p>An annual car inspection or a visual inspection during an oil change is good way to determine your belt&#8217;s current condition, while giving you an idea of when it needs replacement.</p>
+<p>Drive with peace of mind. Have your belt inspected. <a href="/appointment/">Schedule an appointment</a>.</p>
+<h2>What is a &#8220;belt tensioner,&#8221; and what is the benefit of replacing it when a belt is replaced&#63;</h2>
+<p>Many of today&#8217;s vehicles are equipped with a self&#45;tensioning device called an automatic belt tensioner. These tensioners are designed to hold a predetermined amount of tension on the serpentine belt so it functions properly and keeps your car cruising.</p>
+<p>Your serpentine belt is like one giant, fast&#45;spinning rubber band. And, like a rubber band, it must maintain a balance of flexibility and tension. Most tensioners feature an internal spring and pulley, which applies needed force against the serpentine belt to keep it tight. If there is not enough tension, a belt can slip, squeal or run hot. Worst&#45;case scenario&#58; a loose belt may come off of its pulleys. When this happens, all the accessories powered by the engine go kaput and the vehicle will stop running.</p>
+<p><strong>Quick fact</strong>&#58; If your serpentine belt is loose, you may have other mechanical problems like under&#45;performing water pump, which can cause the engine to overheat. Avoid performance loss. Bring your ride in as soon as possible. We&#8217;ll take care of you.</p>
+<p>Need your serpentine belt checked out&#63; <a href="/appointment/">Schedule an appointment today</a>.</p>
+<h2>How many different types of belts are there&#63;</h2>
+<p>A serpentine belt is the most common belt in today&#8217;s cars &#8211; it controls the functionality of most every system for your car. Alternately, your ride may feature a series of V&#45;belts &#40;also known as a fan belts&#41;, which perform the same all&#45;purpose functions as a serpentine belt. Some vehicle&#8217;s may also have a &#8220;toothed&#8221; timing belt in the engine that is key to your overall engine performance. This belt may drive the water, oil pumps and other key parts.</p>
+<h2>What are symptoms my vehicle&#8217;s belt may require a belt replacement&#63;</h2>
+<ul>
+    <li><strong>Chirp or squeal&#58;</strong> When a belt begins slipping, a squealing sound may occur. This is the result of the belt and pulley not working correctly, low belt tension or belt stretch and/or wear. Oil and antifreeze leaks can also contribute to belt slippage. If you hear these sounds, you need to have your ride inspected as soon as possible before further malfunctions occur. And with this sound, they eventually will.</li>
+    <li><strong>System performance loss&#58;</strong> Maybe your power steering has failed, your battery suddenly drains or your engine just stops. All these things are controlled by a properly functioning serpentine or V&#45;belt. Once your belt is compromised, it can produce further damage to the vital systems &#8211; such as the alternator, water pump, power steering and air conditioning &#8211; that depend on it. Unfortunately, the resulting damage can require extensive repair, with very little warning leading up to the event.</li>
+    <li><strong>Check engine light illumination&#58;</strong> This may be an indication something is wrong with the belt.</li>
+</ul>
+<p><strong>Funny noises</strong> may be related to problems with other parts. Never ignore a noise. Where there&#8217;s a noise, there&#8217;s a potential problem. Have your ride inspected and keep your four&#45;wheel investment protected.</p>
+<p>Don&#8217;t ignore the warnings of belt failure. <a href="/appointment/">Schedule an appointment for an inspection</a>.</p>

+    <h2>October Car Care Month Facts</h2>
+    <h3>Life &#40;and car care&#41; is easier when you know the facts.</h3>
+<ol class="date-list">
+    <li><span>October<span>1</span></span>Saving money on gas is a good thing. So is maintaining correct tire pressure. This way, you can achieve a 10 percent boost gas savings, according to the <a href="http://www.aaa.com" rel="external nofollow">American Automobile Association.</a> Since needs vary by vehicle, though, check your owner&#8217;s manual for the proper air pressure for your foursome.</li>
+    <li><span>October<span>2</span></span>File this under &#8220;who knew&#63;&#8221; &#40;Okay, we do.&#41; The &#8220;W&#8221; in your type of oil stands for &#8220;winter.&#8221; And the number before the &#8220;W&#8221; &#40;i.e. <abbr title="Society of Automotive Engineers">SAE</abbr> 5W30&#41; lets you know how easily this oil will pump at low temperatures. 0W is for very low temperatures, and higher numbers like 10W are designed for milder winter weather.</li>
+    <li><span>October<span>3</span></span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Verbiest" rel="external nofollow">Ferdinand Verbiest</a> built the first automobile in 1668. It was a two&#45;foot&#45;long, steam&#45;powered number. How&#8217;s that for proof we&#8217;ve come a long way&#63;</li>
+    <li><span>October<span>4</span></span>Some symptoms your car&#8217;s alignment could be off&#58; your vehicle is pulling to the left or right; you have uneven or rapid tire wear; your steering wheel is crooked when driving straight; or your tires squeal. If any of these ring true, it&#8217;s time for help.</li>
+    <li><span>October<span>5</span></span>The term &#8220;coolant&#8221; is a bit misleading. The truth is, coolant doesn&#8217;t simply control your engine from running hot. It also regulates engine temperature during colder weather. Considering cooler weather is coming, it&#8217;s time to do something about that.</li>
+    <li><span>October<span>6</span></span>Tire inflation levels are measured in <abbr title="pounds per square inch">psi</abbr> &#40;pounds per square inch&#41;. Because air pressure can decrease up to 10 psi a month just through every day driving and may potentially drop 1 psi for every 10 degrees Fahrenheit temperature drop, it&#8217;s important to ready your ride.</li>
+    <li><span>October<span>7</span></span>After seeing snow and rain gathered on trolley cars and automobile windows, Mary Anderson invented the first windshield wipers in 1905. She may not have been the first to notice, but she sure was the first to do something about it. And for that, we thank her.</li>
+    <li><span>October<span>8</span></span>Motor oil keeps your engine lubricated and helps control engine temperatures in both hot and cold weather. Yep, that means changing it is just as important during cold weather as it is when it&#8217;s hot.</li>
+    <li><span>October<span>9</span></span>If you have snow and ice tires, it&#8217;s time for a switcheroo. Think you need a set&#63; <a href="/tires/blizzak/">Blizzaks</a> have your back.</li>
+    <li><span>October<span>10</span></span><a href="http://www.snopes.com/legal/et.asp" rel="external nofollow">Rumor has it,</a> Title 14, Section 1211, of the Code of Federal Regulations once subjected US citizens to a quarantine if they interacted with extraterrestrial vehicles and/or drivers. That&#8217;s right&#58; no mingling with martians, at least not prior to 1991.</li>
+    <li><span>October<span>11</span></span>Snow. Slush. Slippery roads. It&#8217;s no secret stopping power is more important than ever during less&#45;than&#45;ideal winter conditions. Get your brakes checked before the weather turns.</li>
+    <li><span>October<span>12</span></span>It&#8217;s a simple fact&#58; replacing spent spark plugs helps increase fuel economy. The National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence found spark plugs that misfire can reduce fuel efficiency by 30&#37;&#42;. If new plugs are installed at specific intervals, there&#8217;s a very good chance you&#8217;ll maximize fuel economy and save money at the pump. What&#8217;s more, a recent study by the Environmental Protection Agency, says it plays a role in lowering air pollution as well.
+&#42; <a href="http://www.ase.com/News-Events/Publications/Car-Care-Articles/It-s-Easy-Being--Green-.aspx" rel="external nofollow">ASE It&#8217;s Easy Being Green</a></li>
+    <li><span>October<span>13</span></span>In 2011, Americans <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/story/2011-12-07/americans-driving-less/51716466/1" rel="external nofollow">drove less,</a> with six consecutive monthly decreases for the first time since 2008. The reason&#63; High gas prices. Reduce pain at the pump with a properly maintained, fuel&#45;efficient ride.</li>
+    <li><span>October<span>14</span></span>When it comes to the fluid exchanges your vehicle needs, check your owner&#8217;s manual for specific change intervals since most vary by vehicle. You can also use our tool to <a href="/maintenance/schedule.jsp">check your make and model&#8217;s general service intervals.</a></li>
+    <li><span>October<span>15</span></span>Battery power can wind up severely depleted from hot weather. The problem is you might not even know it until the weather turns chilly. That&#8217;s why a <a href="/cf/batteries/everything-you-need-to-know-about-car-batteries/">battery check</a> is due.</li>
+    <li><span>October<span>16</span></span>Clearing your trunk of the extra junk can work wonders when it comes to preserving your rotors and other brake parts. The reason is extra weight puts extra stress on your brakes when you stop. It also affects how quickly you can stop. So take out the sports equipment, shoes and other errant junk in your trunk.</li>
+    <li><span>October<span>17</span></span>Firestone Complete Auto Care has over 1,600 stores nationwide. That&#8217;s about the same amount of paintings rendered by Picasso during his eighty&#45;plus year career. Now ya know.</li>
+    <li><span>October<span>18</span></span>Let&#8217;s do the math&#58; it costs more to replace brake rotors than it does to swap tired brake pads. So before the first signs of brake trouble, get them inspected. What is a brake rotor, you ask&#63; It&#8217;s directly connected to each wheel. To stop your car, the rotor must stop spinning, and the friction caused by the brake pad makes this happen.</li>
+    <li><span>October<span>19</span></span>An &#8220;ED&#45;18&#8221; test on your battery is an &#8220;early detection&#8221; test, and it gauges how much life your battery has left. This test is crucial in determining whether or not you need a new battery.</li>
+    <li><span>October<span>20</span></span>Even the slightest misalignment from hitting potholes and normal wear and tear can lead to premature tire wear &#8211; even if your car&#8217;s alignment is off by 100th of a degree or inch. When this happens, it can lead to further misalignment and the need to replace your tires sooner than you hoped.</li>
+    <li><span>October<span>21</span></span>These days, cars are more fuel&#45;efficient than ever. But gas is also much, much more expensive than it used to be. In 2011 alone, the <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/45727242/Missing_4_155_It_Went_Into_Your_Gas_Tank_This_Year" rel="external nofollow">average American spent &#36;4,155</a> filling up at the pump. That&#8217;s a whole lot of yikes. And it&#8217;s a good reason to maintain your ride.</li>
+    <li><span>October<span>22</span></span>Accessories you plug into your car can drain your car battery. So, unplug the phone charger, iPod or tablet since it may be sucking the life out of your ride&#8217;s battery. The last thing you want is a car that won&#8217;t start because the battery is dead.</li>
+    <li><span>October<span>23</span></span>The thickness of your oil can affect fuel efficiency. It takes more energy &#40;fuel burned&#41; to pump thicker oil versus to thinner oil. More energy usage equals less fuel efficiency. Many newer vehicles run on lower viscosity oils. The lighter the oil, the less energy required to pump it. For optimal performance use the grade of oil recommended in your owner&#8217;s manual.</li>
+    <li><span>October<span>24</span></span>Kangaroos can grow up to be six feet tall and weigh over 200 pounds. Like most humans, they&#8217;d also have trouble fitting into a tiny smart car.</li>
+    <li><span>October<span>25</span></span>Strategic, periodic transmission fluid exchanges help clear your system of impurities. A clean transmission system is free to do its job &#8211; cooling and lubricating the transmission&#8217;s moving parts. Whether for manual or automatic transmission, transmission fluid protects transmission parts and makes it possible to switch gears smoothly.</li>
+    <li>
+            <span>October<span>26</span></span>Time for a fast fact. An air filter protects your engine from dirt and debris. And you can see an 11&#37; improvement in acceleration after replacing a dirty air filter with a new one.&#42; Our Purolator Classic air filters catch up to 95&#37; of harmful contaminants.&#42;&#42;

+    <li><span>October<span>27</span></span>A not so fun fact&#58; Condensation and moisture buildup inside the casings of your car bulbs &#40;headlights, brake lights, etc.&#41; account for most burnouts. Not good.</li>
+    <li><span>October<span>28</span></span>Bad sounds can be signs that your brakes need work. When you push down the brake pedal, do you hear screeching, grinding, rubbing or squealing&#63; These sounds may mean your brake pads need work or your rotors need replacing.</li>
+    <li><span>October<span>29</span></span>Put a penny in your tire tread grooves with the top of Abe&#8217;s head facing down. If you can see the top of his head, that tire is spent and needs to be replaced. Honestly.</li>
+    <li><span>October<span>30</span></span>Bridgestone&#8217;s high&#45;performance Blizzak line includes snow and ice tires for nearly every type of consumer vehicle. And they can stop a 30&#45;mile&#45;per&#45;hour vehicle an average of 35 feet sooner on ice than all&#45;season radials can. Yep, that&#8217;s about two car&#45;lengths sooner.</li>
+    <li><span>October<span>31</span></span>Today is the last day you can get Firestone Complete Auto Care&#8217;s Complete Vehicle Inspection special. Swing by and get one so your car is ready for the winter months ahead.

+<content>
+<![CDATA[<p>Bridgestone Winter Driving School Director and Pro Race Driver Mark Cox lives and drives in the extreme winter conditions of Steamboat Springs, Colorado. Cox has helped Bridgestone Americas Tire Operations pull together the best strategic winter driving tips to take your vehicle on its snow&#45;laden drive this winter and to help you and your family reach your destinations safely.</p>
+    <h2>Before You Drive</h2>
+    <h3>Check windshield wiper blades to make sure they work properly.</h3>
+<p>In some areas, snow blades are an effective alternative to conventional wiper blades.</p>
+<h3>Have your mechanic test the anti&#45;freeze&#47;coolant.</h3>
+<p>This will provide the correct level of protection required in your driving area.</p>
+<h3>Use dedicated snow and ice tires if you live in areas where snow and ice are certainties of winter driving.</h3>
+<p>Snow and ice tires have a softer tread compound and a unique tread design to provide enhanced traction and road&#45;gripping capabilities. Install snow tires all the way around the vehicle, not just on the drive axle.</p>
+<h3>Keep your gas tank at least half&#45;full.</h3>
+<p>The extra volume can help reduce moisture problems within your fuel system. It also adds a margin of safety should you become stopped or stranded during your trip.</p>
+<h3>Try to remove ice and snow from your shoes before getting in your vehicle.</h3>
+<p>As snow and ice melt they can create moisture build&#45;up, causing windows to fog on the inside of the vehicle.</p>
+<h3>Scrape the ice and snow from every window of the vehicle.</h3>
+<p>And the exterior rear view mirrors, not just a small patch on the windshield. Don&#8217;t forget to clean the headlights and brake lights.</p>
+<h3>Buckle up.</h3>
+<p>You and your passengers should always use safety belts including lap and shoulder straps. Pull them snugly to ensure they work properly.</p>
+<h3>Adjust headrests.</h3>
+<p>Position the driver or passenger&#8217;s head rests squarely in the center of the headrest. Rear&#45;end collisions are common in winter driving and a properly adjusted headrest can prevent, or reduce, neck injuries.</p>
+<h3>Turn off your radio.</h3>
+<p>Although your radio can provide helpful traffic information, it can also be a distraction for some drivers. Remember, driving is AS MUCH a mental skill as a physical skill.</p>
+<h3>Stay off your cell phone.</h3>
+<p>Even if you have a hands&#45;free model, you need to concentrate on driving, not on a telephone conversation, when driving on ice or snow.</p>
+<h3>Keep your vehicle stocked with simple emergency equipment.</h3>
+<p>In case you do get stalled or have an accident.</p>
+<h3>Know the weather where you are, where you&#8217;re going and everywhere in between.</h3>
+<p>If snow or ice is predicted, make plans to leave early or arrive later. An alarm clock set to an earlier time can be a good friend in helping you avoid difficulties.</p>
+<h3>If you can move a night trip to daylight hours, do so.</h3>
+<p>Not only is visibility better during daylight, but if your vehicle is stalled, you are more likely to receive prompt assistance during the daytime.</p>
+<h3>Before you shift into gear, plan the best route to your destination.</h3>
+<p>Avoid hills, high congestion areas and bridges if possible.</p>
+<h2>Consider Keeping These Items in Your Vehicle&#58;</h2>
+<ol>
+    <li>A blanket or extra clothes</li>
+    <li>A candle with matches</li>
+    <li>Snacks</li>
+    <li>Beverages &#40;never alcohol&#41;</li>

+    <h2>When You Drive</h2>
+    <h3>Adjust your speed to the current conditions.</h3>
+<p>When driving in challenging conditions, decreasing your speed will allow more time to respond when a difficult situation arises. Factors such as the type of vehicle you are driving, the quality of tires your car is equipped with, and your abilities as a driver should be considered in the speed adjustment. Remember that posted speed limits identify the maximum speed allowed when weather conditions are ideal. Law enforcement agencies can write citations to motorists driving the posted speed limit if weather conditions warrant a slower speed.</p>
+<h3>Anticipate difficult situations.</h3>
+<p>Studies have shown that 80&#37; of all accidents could be prevented with only one more second to react. In many situations, this one second can be gained by looking far enough down the road to identify problems before you become a part of them. Be more alert to the actions of other drivers. Anticipate vehicles coming from side streets and put extra distance between your vehicle and the one in front of you. If someone is too close behind you, don&#8217;t speed up; slow down and let them go around you.</p>
+<h3>Use grip effectively.</h3>
+<p>When roads are slippery, use all of the grip available. Brake only before the curve when the car is traveling straight. Taking your foot off the brake before you steer into the curve allows you to use all of the grip available for steering. Don&#8217;t accelerate until you begin to straighten the steering wheel when exiting the turn. This technique will allow you to be 100&#37; effective at each maneuver. In many situations, better grip or traction can be gained by placing the outside wheels toward the shoulder of the road, out of the ruts in the center. The difference in traction can unbalance the car during the transition from rut to shoulder &#8212; so be alert.</p>
+<h3>Maintain a comfortable driving environment.</h3>
+<p>A constant flow of cool air will help keep you alert, and keep the windows clear of frost. Keeping one window slightly open will allow you to hear sirens and other warning sounds more quickly. When driving, avoid large bulky boots, gloves and coats, and never drive in ski boots.</p>
+<h3>Turn on your lights.</h3>
+<p>When daytime visibility is less than ideal, turning on your lights allows you to see, and to be seen by others. Remember this rule of thumb. Wipers On &#8212; Lights On.</p>
+<h3>When driving at night, leave your head lamps on low beam when driving in snow or fog.</h3>
+<p>This practice minimizes the reflection and glare, improves visibility, and reduces eye fatigue. When oncoming cars approach, focus on the right side of the roadway to help maintain good night vision.</p>
+<h3>Keep a smooth, progressive and light touch on the brakes for normal braking.</h3>
+<p>Even in a car equipped with <abbr title="Anti&#45;Lock Braking System">ABS</abbr> &#40;Anti&#45;Lock Braking System&#41;. In the event of an emergency in an ABS&#45;equipped car, press the pedal HARD and hold it down. Remember that in an ABS&#45;equipped car, you can also steer around many obstacles while braking. Perhaps a better description of ABS would be&#58; &#8220;Allows you to Brake and Steer.&#8221;</p>
+<h3>Keep both hands on the wheel.</h3>
+<p>At 9 o&#8217;clock and 3 o&#8217;clock positions, and steer smoothly in the direction that you want to go. Avoid the &#8220;hand over hand technique.&#8221; Instead, utilize the shuffle technique and keep the right hand on the right side of the wheel and the left hand on the left side of the wheel. While this technique may sound overly simple, it can help you avoid skids.</p>
+<h3>Be careful when using downshifting as a way to slow the vehicle.</h3>
+<p>Even though manual transmissions may provide greater control to assist with braking, gear changes should always be made smoothly in the straightaway before the corner. Abrupt gear changes, especially while cornering, may upset a vehicle&#8217;s balance and cause a skid to occur.</p>
+<h3>Don&#8217;t overestimate the capability of four wheel drive vehicles.</h3>
+<p>Many drivers mistakenly believe that four wheel drive is all&#45;powerful. Every type of vehicle depends on four small contact patches where the tire meets the road for traction. These small areas are the only contact of your vehicle to the road. Four wheel drive does not improve braking or cornering effectiveness.</p>
+<h3>Anti&#45;lock brakes can&#8217;t perform miracles.</h3>
+<p>Don&#8217;t be misled by ABS braking systems. Braking efficiency is limited by the grip available, and the type of tires with which your car is equipped. If you carry too much speed into a corner and then try to brake, even ABS won&#8217;t keep you on the road. Never count on technology to replace good judgment.</p>
+<h3>Wear quality sunglasses.</h3>
+<p>Good quality sunglasses help highlight changes in the terrain and road surface even in low visibility conditions.</p>
+<h3>The world&#8217;s best drivers are trained to anticipate problems early.</h3>
+<p>And direct the vehicle appropriately before they become involved in a problem. Reacting too quickly can be dangerous if the driver&#8217;s response is inappropriate.</p>
+<h3>When driving up a steep hill in icy conditions, gain speed and momentum on the flat before starting uphill.</h3>
+<p>When the car begins to slow part way up the hill ease up on the accelerator, allow the car to slow down and crest the hill slowly. If you try and accelerate too hard and spin the wheels, you may lose momentum and not make it to the top. It&#8217;s better to make the top at a slower speed than to not make it at all.</p>
+<h3>If you do have trouble, and become stopped or stranded, run the engine only briefly &#8212; not continuously &#8212; to run the heater.</h3>
+<p>Regularly make sure that the exhaust pipe is clear of snowdrifts or other obstructions. Carbon monoxide can accumulate more easily in a non&#45;moving vehicle.</p>]]>

+<h2>Things to Know Before You Hit the Road</h2>
+<p>With holiday travel right around the corner, we know that you&#8217;ll be hitting the road more frequently and for longer distances. Knowing that, we want you to have all the tools to stay safe.</p>
+<h3>Make sure your tires are properly inflated.</h3>
+<p>Letting air out of tires to drive in snow can reduce the gripping action of tires because the tread will not meet the road surface as it was designed to do. Over&#45;inflation has the same effect.</p>
+<h3>Keep your gas tank at least half&#45;full.</h3>
+<p>The extra volume can help reduce moisture problems within your fuel system. It also adds a margin of safety should you become stopped or stranded during your trip.</p>
+<h3>Check windshield wiper blades to make sure they work properly.</h3>
+<p>There is nothing worse than getting a few miles into a rainy trip and realizing you can&#8217;t see well.</p>
+<h3>Give your car a once over.</h3>
+<p>By checking all fluids, hoses and lights before leaving you can hit the road with peace of mind.</p> 
+<h3>Consider keeping these items in your vehicle&#58;</h3>
+<ol>
+    <li>A blanket or extra clothes</li>
+    <li>A candle with matches</li>
+    <li>Snacks</li>
+    <li>Water</li>
+    <li>Flares</li>
+    <li><abbr title="Citizens&#8217; Band">C.B.</abbr> radio, cellular phone or hand radio</li>
+    <li>Long jumper cables</li>
+    <li>A small shovel </li>
+    <li>A flashlight</li>
+    <li>A windshield scraping device </li>
+    <li>A tow rope</li>
+    <li>A bag of sand or cat litter for traction</li>
+</ol>
+<h2>Snow Driving Tips</h2>
+<p>And if you are one of the lucky &#40;or unlucky, depending on how you look at it&#41; people that will be driving in cold temperatures, sleet and snow here&#8217;s what you need to know&#33;</p>
+<h3>Use dedicated snow and ice tires if you live in areas where snow and ice are certainties of winter driving.</h3>
+<p>Snow and ice tires have a softer tread compound and a unique tread design to provide enhanced traction and road&#45;gripping capabilities. Install snow tires all the way around the vehicle, not just on the drive axle. <a href="/tires/blizzak/">More information on Blizzak snow tires.</a></p>
+<h3>Have your mechanic test the anti&#45;freeze&#47;coolant.</h3>
+<p>This will provide the correct level of protection required in your driving area. <a href="/appointment/">Schedule an appointment now.</a></p>
+<h3>Try to remove ice and snow from your shoes before getting in your vehicle.</h3>
+<p>As snow and ice melt they can create moisture build&#45;up, causing windows to fog on the inside of the vehicle.</p>
+<h3>Scrape the ice and snow from every window of the vehicle.</h3>
+<p>And scrape exterior rear view mirrors, not just a small patch on the windshield. Don&#8217;t forget to clean the headlights and brake lights.</p> 
+<h3>During winter months, know the weather where you are, where you&#8217;re going and everywhere in between.</h3>
+<p>If snow or ice is predicted, make plans to leave early or arrive later. An alarm clock set to an earlier time can be a good friend in helping you avoid difficulties.</p>
+<h3>4 wheel drives slip on the ice just as much as 2 wheel drives.</h3>
+<p>So slow down on ice, 4x4s&#33;</p>
+<h3>Wash your car on moderately warm days in the early part of the day.</h3>
+<p>This will prevent windows and doors from icing up overnight. In the extreme cold avoid the car wash. Road salt doesn&#8217;t work in these temperatures, thus your car won&#8217;t rust.</p>
+<h3>There&#8217;s a different grade of windshield washer fluid to use in the winter.</h3>
+<p>It&#8217;s a bit more expensive, but will not freeze in temperatures below 32 degrees.</p>
+<h3>Starting your engine and letting it warm up prior to driving is a good idea.</h3>
+<p>Keep in mind that although your engine may be warm and ready to run, other parts&#47;fluids of your car are still cold. For instance, take it easy on your steering pump &#8211; the steering fluid is still cold and will warm up only after use. Drive slowly for a few blocks after pulling out of the driveway to give your car a chance to loosen up &#40;much like you need after waking up in the morning&#41;. This will significantly reduce wear and tear on your car in the long run.</p>
+<h3>Be careful when digging out of the snow.</h3>
+<p>Shoveling can be very tough on your body. A lot of heart attacks happen this way. Also, if you are all alone, take off a few layers before shoveling to prevent sweating &#8211; the last thing you need is hypothermia. Sweat is your enemy. Lift with the knees, not your back.</p>

+<![CDATA[<h2>How Do You Know if You Need New Tires&#63;</h2>
+<p>You need to be aware of three things when deciding if you need new tires&#58; tread wear, exposure to the elements and tire age.</p>
+<h2>Tread Wear</h2>
+<p><a href="/pennytiretest/">Who says a penny doesn&#8217;t buy you anything&#63;</a> With this easy test, a penny can buy you peace of mind when it comes to your tires and safety. Place a penny head first into several tread grooves across the tire. If you always see the top of Lincoln&#8217;s head, your treads are shallow and worn. If this is the case, your tires need to be replaced. If part of Lincoln&#8217;s head is always covered by the tread, you have more than 2&#47;32 of an inch of tread depth remaining. This means you probably don&#8217;t need new tires.</p>
+<h2>Why Worry About Tread Wear&#63;</h2>
+<p>The most important reason to worry about tread wear is safety. When your tire treads are worn, your car may respond poorly in adverse weather conditions like rain and snow. With good treads your car will grip the road better. Also, having insufficient tread is considered illegal in many states. And finally, worn treads can make other parts of your car wear prematurely.</p>
+<h2>Exposure to the Elements</h2>
+<p>Exposure to heat and the sun&#8217;s ultraviolet rays may cause structural changes to your tires. These changes are not usually a concern in moderate climates.</p>
+<h2>Tire Age</h2>
+<p>How old are your tires&#63; Regardless of tread wear, vehicle manufacturers generally recommend you replace your tires at six years. Most tire manufacturers recommend you replace your tires at 10 years. Check the manufacturer&#8217;s recommendations on your specific tires.</p>
+<h2>I Need New Tires</h2>
+<p>When it&#8217;s time to change your tires, your Firestone Complete Auto Care dealer wants to make purchasing a new set as simple as possible. We have the best selection of quality tires to fit your vehicle, your budget and your driving style. From economy to ultra high performance tires &#8212; in the size you need from brands you trust, including our well&#45;known Bridgestone and Firestone brands &#8212; you can <a href="/tires/">Find What You Need Right Here</a>.</p>]]>

+<![CDATA[<p>Getting the most out of your tire investment includes the proper care and maintenance that you can do along with the tire&#45;related services we do at Firestone Complete Auto Care. Free tire inspections by one of our tire professionals are always available, but learn what you can do to get better mileage and performance.</p>
+<h2>What You Should Know About Tires</h2>
+<p>There is valuable information about your tires printed right on the sidewall&#33;</p>
+<img alt="Tire Evaluation" src="/static-fcac/images/cf/articles/tire-sidewall-information.jpg" />
+<h2>Simple Steps to Better Tire Care</h2>
+<a href="http://www.tiresafety.com/" class="left" rel="external nofollow"><img alt="Tire Safety" src="/static-fcac/images/cf/articles/tire-safety-logo.png" /></a>
+<p>Did you know tires can lose 1 <abbr title="pounds per square inch">psi</abbr> of air pressure &#40;pounds per square inch&#41; per month under normal conditions&#63; That&#8217;s why checking your tires on a regular basis is one of the easiest things you can do to maintain your investment. For more helpful tips, visit <a href="http://www.tiresafety.com/" rel="external nofollow">TireSafety.com</a>.</p>
+<h2>4&#45;Tire Rotation</h2>
+<p>Did you know that front tires wear out almost twice as fast as rear tires on a front&#45;wheel drive vehicle&#63; Also keep in mind that uneven tire wear may be due to mechanical problems like a misaligned suspension. On average, tires should be rotated every 5,000 miles and more frequently for high performance tires.</p>
+<img alt="Tire Rotation" src="/static-fcac/images/cf/articles/tire-rotation-diagram.jpg" />
+<h2>Wheel Balancing</h2>
+<p>Do you feel steering wheel vibration between 50 and 70 miles per hour&#63; Out of balance wheels can create poor handling and a significant reduction in fuel mileage. We recommend wheel balancing with every tire rotation.</p>
+<h2>Valve Stem Replacement</h2>
+<p>Loss of air pressure is the number one factor in reduced tire life. When tire valves begin to weather and crack, and&#47;or when valve caps are missing, air seepage is likely to occur. Tire valves should be replaced whenever you purchase new tubeless tires.</p>
+<h2>Tire Installation</h2>
+<p>The variety of tire sizes, designs and specialty wheel applications is growing. That makes it necessary to have qualified tire professionals do the work. Every Firestone Complete Auto Care technician is trained in proper installation techniques and uses state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art mounting equipment.</p>
+<h2>Flat Repair</h2>
+<p>When you bring a damaged tire to Firestone Complete Auto Care, we always start with a full inspection. If your tire can be repaired, your tire technician will fill the damaged area, seal the inner liner, then re&#45;check for leaks before re&#45;installing the tire.</p>
+<h2>What&#8217;s Inside Your Tire&#63;</h2>
+<p>Some basic construction features of a common radial tire&#58;</p>

+<![CDATA[<h2>Do You Need New Tires&#63;</h2>
+<p>You need to be aware of three things when <a href="/cf/tires/time-for-new-tires-know-the-signs/">deciding if you need new tires</a>&#58; tread wear, exposure to the elements and tire age.</p>
+<h2>Air Pressure</h2>
+<p><a href="/cf/tires/find-your-vehicles-recommended-tire-pressure/">Keeping the correct air pressure</a> in your tires helps your tires last longer, helps your car handle better and safer, and helps you save money on fuel. You may use the tool below to view the manufacturer recommended inflations for standard sized tires on your vehicle.</p>
+<h2>Load Index</h2>
+<p>The <a href="/cf/tires/learn-about-tire-load-index/">load index</a> indicates the load&#45;carrying capacity of a tire. In other words, it tells you how much weight your tire can support.</p>
+<h2>Speed Rating</h2>
+<p>The <a href="/cf/tires/tire-speed-rating-explained/">speed rating</a> of a tire indicates the speed category &#40;or range of speeds&#41; at which the tire can carry a load under specified service conditions.</p>
+<h2>Tire Pressure Monitoring System &#40;TPMS&#41;</h2>
+<p><a href="/cf/tires/what-is-a-tire-pressure-monitoring-system-tpms/"><abbr title="Tire Pressure Monitoring System">TPMS</abbr></a> is an electronic system that alerts you with a dashboard indicator light when your car&#8217;s tire pressure falls to the point of needing inflation.</p>
+<h2>Purchasing and Mounting Tires</h2>
+<p>Generally, <a href="/cf/tires/buying-new-tires-tire-mounting-tips/">new tires</a> provide increased resistance to hydroplaning due to their full tread depth. With new tires on the rear, an oversteer skidding condition may be more easily avoided.</p>

+    <p>To help drivers recognize the importance of tire pressure safety and maintenance, Congress passed the <abbr title="Transportation Recall Enhancement, Accountability, and Documentation">TREAD</abbr> act,

+    <h2>How Does TPMS Work&#63;</h2>
+    <p>To help you make informed decisions about TPMS, it&#8217;s important to know how each system&mdash;Direct and Indirect&mdash;works. Direct uses a sensor located in the tire assembly that transmits data to your vehicle&#8217;s computer system. It measures the tire&#8217;s pressure and notifies the driver when pressure drops 25 percent or more below the manufacturer&#8217;s recommended level. Indirect TPMS uses the Antilock Braking System &#40;ABS&#41; to gauge tire pressure by measuring the difference in diameter of each tire. Our Firestone Complete Auto Care expert technicians can tell you which system your vehicle uses.</p>
+    <h2>What Are the Benefits of TPMS&#63;</h2>
+    <p>TPMS notifies you when your vehicle&#8217;s tire pressure is low or is going flat. By helping you maintain proper tire pressure, TPMS can increase your safety on the road by improving your vehicle&#8217;s handling, decreasing tire wear, reducing braking distance and bettering fuel economy.</p>
+    <h2>Is Your Vehicle Equipped with TPMS&#63;</h2>
+    <p>Your vehicle has TPMS if the &#8220;low tire pressure&#8221; warning light appears on your dash when the key is turned to the &#34;on&#34; position.</p>
+    <h2>How Can Our Technicians Help&#63;</h2>
+    <p>If your vehicle&#8217;s TPMS warning indicator light comes on, there is a tire pressure problem.
+    Stop into Firestone Complete Auto Care and our technicians will take care of your needs. They&#8217;ll check your vehicle&#8217;s tire pressure
+    and perform a systems test on all of your tire sensors to diagnose the problem. Once our technicians address your vehicle&#8217;s tire needs, they&#8217;ll then suggest the proper maintenance to get you back on the road.</p>
+    <h2>Why Does Tire Maintenance with Direct TPMS Cost More&#63;</h2>
+    <p>Direct TPMS equipped tires cost slightly more to maintain than non&#45;equipped tires because proper care requires extra parts and labor. The valve service kit, which includes the valve core, cap, nut and o&#45;ring &#40;seal&#41;, must always be replaced when a tire is dismounted for service or replacement. The service kit costs &#36;5&#45;&#36;10 per wheel on most vehicles. A special TPMS tool and additional time are also needed to check and reset the sensor system. In the event pressure sensors need to be replaced,
+    the cost ranges from &#36;50&#45;&#36;250 each depending on vehicle type.</p>

+    <h2>Why Correct Tire Pressure Matters</h2>
+    <p>Keeping the correct air pressure in your tires helps your tires last longer, helps your car handle better and safer, and helps you save money on fuel.</p>
+    <h2>Check Tire Pressure Regularly</h2>
+    <p>Most people forget about their tires until something goes wrong. The truth is, tires lose pressure daily. In cool weather, a tire will typically lose one or two pounds of air per month. In warm weather, tires lose even more air. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s recommended that you check air pressure every other time you stop to fill up your gas tank. Keep in mind that many vehicles have different tire pressures on the front and rear axle. And don&#8217;t forget to check the pressure in your spare tire.</p>
+    <h2>What Is the Correct Pressure&#63;</h2>
+    <p>The first place to look for the correct air pressure for your specific tires is your vehicle owner&#8217;s manual. Correct air pressure should also be listed on the tire placard attached to the vehicle door edge, doorpost, glove box door or fuel door.</p>

+    </div>
+    <p>Generally, new tires provide increased resistance to hydroplaning due to their full tread depth. With new tires on the rear, an oversteer skidding condition may be more easily avoided.</p>
+    <p>Whether your vehicle is front&#45;, rear&#45;, or all&#45;wheel drive, if your rear tires lose traction because of hydroplaning on a wet road, an oversteer skidding condition may result and lead to loss of control, particularly in a turn.</p>
+    <p>Additional or alternate recommendations may apply for some vehicles. Always refer to and follow the vehicle manufacturer&#8217;s tire replacement and tire application recommendations; consult  your vehicle owner&#8217;s manual and tire information placard.</p>
+    <p>Driving your vehicle with an improper mix of tires is dangerous. Your vehicle&#8217;s handling characteristics can be seriously affected. You could have an accident resulting in serious personal injury or death. Consult your vehicle owner&#8217;s manual, tire information placard, and a qualified service professional for proper tire replacement.</p>

+<content>
+<![CDATA[<h2>What Is the Proper Inflation for My Tires&#63;</h2>
+<p>Bridgestone&#47;Firestone recommends using the tire pressure that the vehicle manufacturer recommends. This information located on the Tire Information Placard is normally located on the inside driver&#8217;s door jamb. We suggest you do not deviate from this tire pressure. Pressure requirements may change when plus sizing tires. You may use the <a href="/tires/tirepressure.jsp">Recommended Tire Pressure Lookup Tool</a> to view the manufacturer recommended inflations for standard sized tires on your vehicle.</p>
+<h2>What Is the Mileage Warranty on My Original Equipment &#40;O.E.&#41; Tires&#63;</h2>
+<p><abbr title="Original Equipment">O.E.</abbr> tires are designed to the vehicle manufacturer&#8217;s specifications and do not offer a mileage warranty. However, your tires are warranted for workmanship and material defects.</p>
+<h2>What Is the Rolling Resistance of My Tires&#63;</h2>
+<p>Rolling resistance has traditionally been measured through <abbr title="Society of Automotive Engineers">SAE</abbr> test procedure J1269. It measures the force required to roll a tire against a dynamometer at a fixed speed of 50 <abbr title="miles per hour">mph</abbr>. Within Bridgestone&#47;Firestone, we have over 1,300 passenger and light truck products in the Bridgestone line alone and, conceivably, each one could have a different rolling resistance. The tread compound is a major factor, but construction, size, and even tread pattern can have an influence. At least 3 tires must be run in each configuration to get a good average. At approximately 1 hour per rolling resistance test, this amounts to 3,900 hours or over 6 months just to run the Bridgestone brand.</p>
+<p>This explains why these values are estimated. We have some data, however it frequently does not line up with those sizes or patterns requested. Therefore, estimation is required.</p>
+<p>These estimates are made by independent organizations. Bridgestone&#47;Firestone does not test for rolling resistance.</p>
+<h2>What Is Meant by Speed Rating&#63;</h2>
+<p>The speed rating of a tire indicates the speed category &#40;or range of speeds&#41; at which the tire can carry a load under specified service conditions. The speed rating system used today was developed in Europe in response to the need to control the safe performance of tires at standardized speeds. A letter from A to Z symbolizes a tire&#8217;s certified speed rating, ranging from 5 <abbr title="kilometers per hour">km&#47;h</abbr> &#40;3 mph&#41; to above 300 km&#47;h &#40;186 mph&#41;. This rating system, listed below, describes the top speed for which a tire is certified. It does not indicate the total performance capability of a tire.</p>
+<p>When this speed rating system was originally developed, the Unlimited V category of over 210 km&#47;h &#40;130 mph&#41; was the top speed rating a tire could achieve.</p>
+<p>As manufacturers made more tires that did not fit this category, it was necessary to better regulate performance at standardized speeds to ensure safety. The Limited V category of 250 km/h &#40;149 mph&#41; was then created, and the Z speed rating was added as the top speed rating that a tire could achieve. W and Y limited speed symbols have been added as higher speed categories.</p>
+<p>Always consult the manufacturer for the maximum speed of Unlimited Z tires. Speed rating is identified as a part of the tire&#8217;s sizing or service description.</p>
+<p>In the latest attempt to standardize tire designations, all ratings except Unlimited ZR incorporate the speed symbol and load index as the tire&#8217;s service description. For example&#58;</p>

+        <h2>What Does UTQG Mean&#63;</h2>
+        <h3>Uniform Tire Quality Grading</h3>
+<p><abbr title="Uniform Tire Quality Grading">UTQG</abbr> is intended to provide simple, comparative data for your use in making an informed buying decision. However, the ratings are based upon test results achieved under very specific conditions. As a result, misinterpreting the comparative data as it relates specifically to your particular driving habits, conditions, etc., is a possibility.  UTQG designates the comparative performance levels of a tire based upon government&#45;specified tests. Tire manufacturers and brand name owners are required to grade regular and all&#45;season tires in three categories&#58; Treadwear, Traction, and Temperature.</p>
+<h3>DOT Quality Grades</h3>
+<p>All passenger car tires must conform to Federal Safety Requirements in addition to these grades.</p>
+<h3>Treadwear</h3>
+<p>The treadwear grade is a comparative grade assigned by the manufacturer based on the wear rate of a tire when tested under controlled conditions on a course that meets government&#45;specified requirements. For example, a tire graded 150 would wear one and a half &#40;1 1&#47;2&#41; times as well as a tire graded 100 under the controlled test conditions. The relative performance of tires depends upon the actual conditions of their use and may depart significantly from the norm due to variations in driving habits, service practices and differences in road characteristics.</p>
+<h3>Traction AA, A, B, C</h3>
+<p>The traction grade is based on wet skid tests of a tire on government&#45;specified concrete and asphalt surfaces. The traction grade is based on a straight&#45;ahead wet braking traction test and does not include a cornering traction test. The comparative tire grade letters, AA, A, B, and C &#40;AA being the highest and C being the lowest&#41; represent the tire&#8217;s ability to stop the vehicle on wet pavement under the controlled test conditions. Ice and snow traction capabilities are not tested.</p>
+<strong>WARNING&#58;</strong>
+<p>The traction grade assigned is based on braking &#40;straight ahead&#41; traction test and does not include cornering &#40;turning&#41; traction.</p>
+<h3>Temperature A, B, C</h3>
+<p>The temperature grade is based on an indoor, high&#45;speed test that meets government&#45;specified requirements. The comparative grade letters, A, B, and C &#40;A being the highest and C being the lowest&#41; represent the tire&#8217;s resistance to the generation of heat and its ability to dissipate heat when tested under controlled conditions on a specified indoor laboratory test wheel.</p>
+<p>Sustained high temperature can cause the material of the tire to degenerate and reduce tire life, and excessive temperature can lead to sudden tire failure. The grade C corresponds to a level of performance which all passenger car tires must meet under the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 109. Grades A and B represent higher levels of performance on the laboratory test wheel than the minimum required by law.</p>
+<strong>WARNING&#58;</strong>
+<p>The temperature grade is established for a tire that is properly inflated and not overloaded. Excessive speed, under inflation, or excessive loading, either separately or in combination, can cause heat buildup and possible tire failure.</p>
+<h3>Example &#35;1&#58;</h3>
+<p>A tire with the ratings of TREADWEAR 80, TRACTION B, TEMPERATURE C, is interpreted by the manufacturer as having&#58;</p>
+<ul>
+    <li>TREADWEAR grade less than that of a tire graded 100.</li>
+    <li>TRACTION capability greater than tires of C grade, but not as good as tires of AA or A grade.</li>
+    <li>TEMPERATURE performance on the laboratory high&#45;speed test greater than required by the government standards, but less than tires graded B or A.</li>
+</ul>
+<h3>Example #2&#58;</h3>
+<p>A tire with same brand name and same construction type with ratings of TREADWEAR 160, TRACTION A, TEMPERATURE B, compares to the tire in example #1 as follows&#58;</p>
+<ul>
+    <li>TREADWEAR is graded two times better than the tire in example &#35;1.</li>
+    <li>Wet TRACTION and TEMPERATURE are better than the tire in example &#35;1.</li>
+</ul>
+<strong>IMPORTANT NOTE</strong>
+<p>Keep in mind that comparing the performance of various tires is too complex to be based exclusively on UTQG grades.</p>
+<ul>
+    <li>UTQG grades are not government grades. They are manufacturer grades that are not based on head&#45;to&#45;head interbrand testing. Test data is not typically submitted to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.</li>
+    <li>Treadwear grades are not a guarantee for a given mileage warranty, or an indicator of overall tire quality. Treadwear grades are assigned by the manufacturer for comparison purposes within the same brand names and construction types only.</li>
+    <li>UTQG grades are not safety ratings. Overall tire quality and safety are not graded. Tire selection based on any one, two, or even three UTQG ratings may not satisfy your needs.</li>
+    <li>One brand name of tires cannot be considered superior or inferior to another brand name of tires based solely on UTQG grades.</li>
+    <li>UTQG grades are not required for snow tires, light truck tires and maximum traction tires.</li>
+    <li>UTQG is used but not required in Canada.</li>
+</ul>
+<h2>What Do I Need to Know About Tire Repair&#63;</h2>
+<p>Driving an improperly repaired tire is dangerous. An improper repair can be unreliable or permit further damage to the tire. The tire may suddenly fail, causing serious personal injury or death. A complete inspection and repair of your tire in accordance with Rubber Manufacturers Association &#40;<abbr title="Rubber Manufacturers Association">RMA</abbr>&#41; procedures should be conducted by a qualified tire service professional.</p>
+<p>A proper tire repair includes the following&#58;</p>
+<ul>
+    <li><strong>The tire is demounted from the wheel for a complete inspection, inside and out.</strong> Some damage to the tire may only be evident on the interior of the tire.</li>
+    <li><strong>The puncture injury is &#188; inch &#40;6 <abbr title="millimeters">mm</abbr>&#41; or less and must be within the tread area.</strong> This helps ensure the long&#45;term tire and repair durability.</li>
+    <li><strong>A patch is applied to the interior of the tire and the puncture hole is filled with a suitable plug&#47;stem filler.</strong> This helps ensure that the interior of the tire is adequately sealed to prevent inflation pressure loss and prevents contamination of the steel belts and other plies from the elements &#40;such as water&#41; in the outside world.</li>
+</ul>
+<p>Additional notes about tire repairs&#58;</p>
+<ul>
+    <li>
+      Not all punctured or damaged tires can be properly repaired; consequently, some tires must be replaced. NEVER repair a tire with any of the following conditions&#58;
+      <ul>
+        <li>Wear to the tire&#8217;s built&#45;in treadwear indicators or to 2&#47;32 inch &#40;1.6 mm&#41; remaining tread depth in any area of the tread.</li>
+        <li>With a puncture larger than &frac14; inch &#40;6 mm&#41;.</li>
+        <li>With a puncture or other damage outside the repairable tread area.</li>
+        <li>With a pre&#45;existing, improper repair.</li>
+      </ul>
+    </li>
+    <li>Any tire repair done without removing the tire from the wheel is improper. The tire must be demounted from the wheel and the interior inspected for damage that may not be evident on the exterior of the tire.</li>
+    <li>Using only a plug&#47;stem, or using only a patch, is not a safe or proper repair. A patch must be applied to the interior of the tire and the puncture hole must be filled with a suitable plug&#47;stem filler to prevent inflation pressure loss and contamination of the steel belts and other plies.</li>
+    <li>NEVER substitute a tube for a proper repair or to remedy an improper repair.</li>
+    <li>Tubes, like tires, should only be repaired by a qualified tire service professional.</li>
+    <li>Some vehicle manufacturers do not recommend using repaired tires. Consult your vehicle owner&#8217;s manual or contact the vehicle manufacturer before operating a repaired tire on your vehicle.</li>
+    <li>The tire&#8217;s speed rating is void if the tire is repaired, retreaded, damaged, abused, or otherwise altered from its original condition. It should be treated as a non&#45;speed rated tire.</li>
+</ul>
+<h2>What Is the Repairable Area of a Non&#45;RFT &#40;Run Flat&#41; Tire&#63;</h2>
+<p>We only repair tires in accordance with the <abbr title="Rubber Manufacturers Association">RMA</abbr> recommended procedures. Some punctures cannot be seen with the naked eye and other measures are taken to find such punctures &#40;soapy water and tire water tubs&#41;.</p>
+<h2>What Is the Repairable Area of an RFT &#40;Run Flat&#41; Tire&#63;</h2>
+<p>No tire, regardless of its design or quality, is indestructible. <abbr title="Run Flat">RFT</abbr> tires can be ultimately rendered unusable due to a puncture or other road hazard as well as from improper run&#45;flat or low pressure operation. Some punctures may be repaired under certain circumstances, with restrictions and subject to prescribed procedures.</p>
+<p>When driven flat or with low pressure, factors affecting reparability include vehicle speed, load, handling and maneuvering; the amount of inflation pressure lost; and ambient temperature. In any situation, the extent and location of direct damage from a puncturing object or other road hazard are also critical factors.</p>
+<p>RFT tires are not repairable in any of the following situations&#58;</p>
+<ul>
+    <li>If the tire is described as, &#8220;Do Not Repair&#8221; on the sidewall.</li>
+    <li>If the tire was operated with inflation pressure less than 15 <abbr title="pounds per square inch">psi</abbr> &#40;100 <abbr title="kilopascal">kPa</abbr>&#41;.</li>
+    <li>Abrasion or other damage is present on the exterior tread, sidewall or bead areas.</li>
+    <li>Abrasion, wrinkling, or separation is present on the tire interior.</li>
+    <li>Any condition or damage is present that disqualifies repair of a conventional tire.</li>
+</ul>
+<p>Run&#45;Flat Certified Retailers will fully inspect your tire, inside and out, to determine if the tire can be repaired. Tire damage is not always visible from the outside and the tire must be removed from the wheel for a complete inspection.</p>
+<p>Note&#58; Some vehicle manufacturers recommend not using repaired tires. Such recommendations apply to RFT tires. Use of RFT tires deemed non&#45;repairable may result in damage to the vehicle, injury, or death. Consult your vehicle owner&#8217;s manual or contact the vehicle manufacturer before operating a repaired tire on your vehicle.</p>
+<h2>Why Did My Tires Wear So Quickly&#63;</h2>
+<p>Premature tire wear may be caused by many factors other than tire rotation. Some examples are as follows&#58; improper inflation, driving conditions, misaligned vehicles, worn vehicle parts and many other reasons.</p>
+<p>Without physically inspecting the tires it is difficult to make a determination as to why your tires wore prematurely. Please visit our location and have one of our trained professionals inspect your tires free of charge.</p>
+<h2>Does Nitrogen Make a Difference in Tires&#63;</h2>
+<p>Recently, some tire shops and filling stations have been offering Nitrogen &#40;N2&#41; as an inflation gas for passenger and light truck tires. Nitrogen is acceptable as an inflation gas for use in Bridgestone and Firestone passenger, light truck, and truck tires.</p>
+<p>Bridgestone and Firestone tire innerliners are designed to act as pressure retention devices, specifically with the use of air, providing durability for the life of the tire and restricting air loss due to permeability. Nitrogen will not cause any detrimental reaction to the innerliner.</p>
+<p>Bridgestone&#47;Firestone passes no judgment on the claims stated by various Nitrogen suppliers.</p>
+<h2>Will You Beat Competitors&#8217; Prices&#63;</h2>
+<p>Our Priced Right Guarantee means we&#8217;ll match any comparable tire price, or we&#8217;ll refund 150&#37; of the price difference on your tire purchase within 30 days.</p>
+<p>This guarantee extends to the Customer, within thirty &#40;30&#41; days after the date of purchase, a refund of 150&#37; of the difference between a current locally&#45;advertised lower price on a similar make&#47;model tire and the price of a tire purchased from a Firestone Complete Auto Care store. Customer must provide a current local advertisement. This guarantee excludes clearances, closeouts and catalogs. This refund is not to be combined with any other offer or used to reduce outstanding debt.</p>]]>

+<![CDATA[<p>The load index indicates the load&#45;carrying capacity of a tire.  In other words, it tells you how much weight your tire can support. For example, if a tire has a load index of 92, it can support 1,389 pounds at maximum air pressure. Multiply that by four tires &#40;4 x 1,389 &#61; 5,556 pounds&#41; to get your car&#8217;s maximum load&#45;carrying capacity. Never install tires with a lower load carrying capacity than the tires originally installed on your car in the factory.</p>

+<p>The speed rating of a tire indicates the speed category &#40;or range of speeds&#41; at which the tire can carry a load under specified service conditions. The speed rating system used today was developed in Europe in response to the need to control the safe performance of tires at standardized speeds. A letter from A to Z symbolizes a tire&#8217;s certified speed rating, ranging from 5 <abbr title="kilometers">km</abbr>&#47;<abbr title="hour">h</abbr> &#40;3<abbr title="miles per hour">mph</abbr>&#41; to above 300 km&#47;h &#40;186 mph&#41;. This rating system, listed below, describes the top speed for which a tire is certified. It does not indicate the total performance capability of a tire.</p>
+<p>When this speed rating system was originally developed, the Unlimited V category of over 210 km/h &#40;130 mph&#41; was the top speed rating a tire could achieve.</p>
+<p>As manufacturers made more tires that did not fit this category, it was necessary to better regulate performance at standardized speeds to ensure safety. The Limited V category of 250 km/h &#40;149 mph&#41; was then created, and the Z speed rating was added as the top speed rating that a tire could achieve. W and Y limited speed symbols have been added as higher speed categories.</p>
+<p>Always consult the manufacturer for the maximum speed of Unlimited Z tires. Speed rating is identified as a part of the tire&#8217;s sizing or service description.</p>
+<p>In the latest attempt to standardize tire designations, all ratings except Unlimited ZR incorporate the speed symbol and load index as the tire&#8217;s service description. For example&#58;</p>

+<![CDATA[<p>Here&#8217;s a no brainer&#58; hitting a pothole can damage your vehicle. Big time. The thing is, pothole damage is an every day road hazard and a tricky one at that, since potholes&#8217; presence may not be obvious. That is, until the deed is done.</p>
+<p>If your vehicle hits a deep, dreaded divot in the road, steering system misalignment to a full&#45;on tire puncture or bent rims may follow. Cue the &#8220;gulp.&#8221; But whether the damage is obvious or not, the problem needs reversing. And sooner, not later.</p>
+<p>When your vehicle experiences the sudden jolt from a pothole run&#45;in, timely inspection is required. Otherwise, you could be up the creek with costlier damage and stress to other, budget&#45;breaking vehicle parts and systems. Our experienced auto care experts will assess any potential problems during a complete vehicle inspection and set your ride right.</p>
+<h3>Pothole damage. A potential nightmare for other parts.</h3>

+<h2>Pothole damage. The dreaded reality.</h2>
+<p>Say you hit a pothole straight on. Or maybe you nicked one, just barely. Either way, your vehicle likely sustained some damage. But just how much depends on the pothole&#8217;s depth and your speed on impact. Sound like a bummer&#63; It is. Especially since only some vehicle damage &#8211; like a flat tire &#8211; is apparent. Other kinds, such as minor misalignment or damaged steering or suspension, aren&#8217;t always as clear. Yet, these problems can have long&#45;term, lousy effects. Think premature, uneven tire wear. Even costly, too&#45;soon tire replacement.</p>

Using a trained eye, they&#8217;ll catch problems from pothole damage and help repair your ride, pronto.</p>

That way, we can identify and correct the negative effects of pothole damage. And help save you from costlier damage to your car&#8217;s valuable parts.</p>
+<h2>There are some signs. When pothole damage occurs.</h2>
+<p><strong>Tires</strong>&#58; If your wheels ram into a pothole, your tire&#8217;s sidewall can bulge. Sound like bad news&#63; It is, and it needs a fast fix.</p>
+<p><strong>Rims</strong>&#58; Unless your car is equipped with older steel rims, they&#8217;re likely aluminum&#45;based. That means they&#8217;re susceptible to dents. And if the pothole damage comes from a deep depression, hit at high speed&#63; Bent rims may also be on the agenda. That&#8217;s where professional technicians at Firestone Complete Auto Care come in. Correcting the havoc&#63; That&#8217;s what we do.</p>
+<p><strong>Undercarriage</strong>&#58; Hitting a pothole can dent or puncture the undercarriage of your ride. In other words, fluid leaks and wear leading to rust formation are just the beginning. During a complete vehicle inspection, our technicians will look for woes of all kinds. That includes damage resulting from potholes.</p>
+<p><strong>Exhaust System</strong>&#58; Are weird noises coming from your exhaust system&#63; Uh&#45;oh. Hitting a pothole may have damaged your ride. Getting a complete vehicle inspection to assess the situation&#63; It&#8217;s imperative.</p>
+<h2>Avoiding pothole damage. Your vehicle&#8217;s best bet.</h2>
+<p>Want to avoid pothole problems entirely&#63; Who doesn&#8217;t&#63; The easy answer is to bypass them, period. Unfortunately, unexpected encounters with potholes are commonplace. Worse yet, some potholes aren&#8217;t very visible, and others appear out of nowhere. Here are some tips to help avoid pothole damage. After all, it&#8217;s wise.</p>
+<ul>
+ <li>A good starting point&#63; To maintain your manufacturer&#8217;s recommended tire air pressure since properly inflated tires provide the best buffer between broken, dipping pavement and your ride&#8217;s wheel rims. And over or under&#45;inflating your tires&#63; Neither is good&#58; too&#45;firm tires are as bad as too&#45;soft ones when it comes to preventing pothole damage.</li>
+ <li>Prevention is the best medicine. That&#8217;s why leaving enough space between you and the vehicle in front of you is key. That way, you&#8217;re more likely to spot potholes before they wreak havoc on your ride. Whenever it&#8217;s possible to safely avoid broken pavement, do.</li>
+ <li>During damp, inclement weather, it&#8217;s tough to judge the depth and size of a pothole &#8211; or see it at all. When driving during crummy weather, proceed at a reduced speed. That extra caution may help you identify driving hazards, such as potholes, before they can cause damage your vehicle.</li>

+    <h2>A fuel&#45;efficient, eco&#45;friendly alternative to compressed air.</h2>
+    <h3>Here&#8217;s how using Nitrogen in your tires can help you keep your car running newer, longer.</h3>
+<div class="col col-primary">
+    <img src="/static-fcac/images/cf/articles/nitrogen-tire-inflation-service.jpg" alt="Nitrogen Tire Inflation Service&#58; A fuel&#45;efficient, eco&#45;friendly alternative to compressed air." />
+    <h4>Tire Pressure</h4>
+    <p>Because of its larger molecular size, nitrogen migrates through a tire three to four times slower than oxygen. A tire filled with compressed air will lose 1 <abbr title="pounds per square inch">PSI</abbr> in less than a month; with nitrogen this could take three months or longer.</p>
+    <h4>Fuel Economy</h4>
+    <p>Proper tire pressure lessens rolling resistance and helps maintain optimum fuel economy between services.</p>
+    <h4>Tire Life</h4>
+    <p>Setting into your tire. It will also optimize your vehicle&#8217;s handling and ride characteristics.</p>
+    <h4>TPMS</h4>
+    <p>For vehicles equipped with a tire pressure monitoring system &#40;<abbr title="tire pressure monitoring system">TPMS</abbr>&#41;, nitrogen provides for more consistent tire pressure, reducing the likelihood of alerts triggered solely by fluctuations in outside temperature.&#8230;and it&#8217;s better for the environment&#33;</p>
+    <h4>Environment</h4>
+    <p>The optimal fuel economy you can maintain more easily with nitrogen will produce less air pollution and less greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
+    <p>Remember, just because your tires are filled with Nitrogen doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t top them off with regular air. It&#8217;s best to use Nitrogen in your tires whenever possible, but if you run into a situation where you can&#8217;t get it, go ahead and top off with air. Then when you get a chance, head back to the store that inflated your tires with nitrogen for a refill. It is recommended that you continue to check your tire pressure periodically.</p>

+        <h2>Brake Basics</h2>
+        <h3>How do brakes work&#63;</h3>
+<p>Just as your ankle bone is connected to your foot bone, your brake system relies on each connected brake part to function successfully &#8212; and safely.</p>
+<p>Here&#8217;s a quick lesson&#58; By pressing down on the brake pedal, you activate the cylinder that delivers brake fluid to the calipers that then engage your brake pads. Your brake pads then apply pressure to the rotors, creating the friction needed to stop your car. You see, it&#8217;s all connected.</p>
+<p>All your brake parts work together to perform one important and crucial function&#58; safe and precise stopping power.</p>                                                        
+<h3>What is a Brake Inspection&#63;</h3>
+<p>Thorough, comprehensive, extensive, and methodical are just a few characteristics that describe our brake inspections. When we say brake inspection, we not only mean it, but we demonstrate it on every automobile we service. Because in order to detect a problem, we need technicians that not only can spot potential problems, but also have the know&#45;how and precision to regain brake awesomeness. When we&#8217;re finished, you&#8217;ll have total confidence knowing your ride has received a brake inspection that&#8217;s hard to match.</p>
+<p>Brake Inspection includes checking your brake&#58;</p>
+<ul>
+    <li>pads &#40;and&#47;or shoes&#41;</li>
+    <li>calipers</li>
+    <li>rotors &#40;and/or drums&#41;</li>
+    <li>wheel cylinders</li>
+    <li>hardware &#40;springs and adjusters&#41;</li>
+    <li>hoses</li>
+    <li>parking brake cables</li>
+    <li>fluid condition</li>
+    <li>wheel bearings and grease seals</li>
+    <li>master cylinder fluid exchange</li>                                                        
+</ul>
+<p><a href="/appointment/">Schedule your Complete Brake Inspection</a></p>
+<h3>How often should I have my brakes inspected&#63;</h3>
+<p>When you visit your doctor for a physical on a yearly basis, you&#8217;re being smart about your health. Same goes for your brakes. A yearly checkup will not only give you the confidence and guidance of our expert technicians, it will also provide you with the best opportunity to spot the necessary smaller repairs to avoid the bigger and more expensive ones. If you&#8217;re experiencing any warning symptoms, then a more immediate inspection may be required.</p>
+<p>Consult your owner&#8217;s manual for specific brake inspection intervals for your particular make and model.</p>
+<p><a href="/appointment/">Schedule a Brake Inspection Today</a></p>
+<h3>What are brake pads&#63;</h3>
+<p>Brake pads are the parts that contact your rotors and cause friction in order to stop your car.</p>
+<h3>What&#8217;s a rotor&#63;</h3>
+<p>The rotor is directly connected to each tire. To stop your car, the rotor must stop spinning. It stops spinning by friction created by the brake pad.</p>
+<h3>What&#8217;s a caliper&#63;</h3>
+<p>The caliper applies pressure and activates brake pads so the pads create contact with the rotors. The caliper requires brake fluid in order to function properly.</p>
+<h3>What&#8217;s a brake hose&#63;</h3>
+<p>When you press down on your brake pedal, brake fluid travels through the brake hose to each caliper, which puts the brake pads into action.</p>
+<h3>What exactly is brake fluid&#63;</h3>
+<p>Brake fluid is a crucial element needed to make your brakes operate successfully. When pressure is generated in the brake fluid lines, energy is distributed to your brake parts so they can perform their main job &#8212; stopping your car. If you have a brake fluid leak, your car could take longer to stop or, worse, won&#8217;t stop at all. If your vehicle has no brake fluid, you&#8217;re brakes won&#8217;t even operate. And that&#8217;s a scary situation we&#8217;d never wish on anybody.</p>]]>

+<![CDATA[
+    <h2>Brake Problem Symptoms</h2>
+    <h3>Why is it important to get my brakes inspected at the first sign of a symptom&#63;</h3>
+
+<p>When your car starts creating abnormal sounds, feelings or smells, start investigating the issue sooner rather than letting the condition worsen. Waiting will only lead to more expensive parts wearing out and requiring replacement. For example, rotors start to warp and become damaged when completely worn brake pads and shoes exceed their lifespan, shortening the life of healthy parts due to the metal on metal grinding that occurs.</p>
+<h3>What sounds, noises and sensations indicate I need brake repairs&#63;</h3>
+<p>Pay attention. Sounds, smells and sensations signal brake problems&#58;</p>
+<ul>
+    <li><strong>Screeching, grinding, squealing, rubbing and other eardrum piercing noises</strong> are common indicators that your brake pads &amp; shoes require inspection. This should be addressed before worn pads cause damage to other parts, which could result in more expensive repairs.
+    </li>
+    <li><strong>Vibration and pulsation in the pedal or your steering wheel.</strong> If this is a familiar feeling, your brake system is telling you something. Wait any longer, and your rotors might get warped from the metal on metal rubbing, potentially costing you a lot more in repair. Stop in as soon as possible if you are experiencing this unpleasant problem.
+    </li>
+    <li><strong>Pressing down farther to complete braking functions.</strong> This symptom is not as prevalent as it used to be, but if you&#8217;re pressing down farther than usual on your brake pedal to stop your car, requiring more pressure and time to perform the same stopping function, you have entered the first stage and sign of brake pad wear. Don&#8217;t play around with your brake pedal, you can only press so far before you&#8217;re in a frightening, &quot;I have no brakes&quot; predicament.
+    </li>
+    <li><strong>That pungent burning smell near your tires is screaming &quot;help!&quot;</strong> If you&#8217;re detecting noxious odors emitting from your tires, stop what you&#8217;re doing and please call or visit your local Firestone Complete Auto Care. Unfamiliar and pungent smells, such as what you&#8217;re experiencing, are not normal and could have dangerous consequences if you continue to drive under these unsafe conditions. Your best solution is our brake inspection to see what part of your braking system has been compromised while driving with this smelly symptom.
+    </li>
+    <li><strong>Brake warning light.</strong> If your brake warning light comes on visit us as soon as possible and ask us to perform a free brake inspection.</li>
+</ul>
+<h3>What other warning signs can I look for if I think my brakes are wearing out&#63;</h3>
+<p>There are many nuances to every car&#8217;s braking system, so we&#8217;d rather not overload you with worst case scenarios and model specific warning signs. We wouldn&#8217;t want you to go through the trouble &#8212; or worry &#8212; of diagnosing a symptom that is rare and hard to detect on your own.</p>
+<p>If you have questions about your braking system that weren&#8217;t described in the previous questions, please call your local Firestone Complete Auto Care to schedule a brake inspection. Once and inspection is done we&#8217;ll diagnose the problem and provide an estimate for repairs.</p>

+</p>
+<h3>How can I ensure my rotors last longer&#63;</h3>
+<p>First, we&#8217;d like to praise you for your foresight and great wisdom in your pursuit to protect your ride. Now that we&#8217;ve gotten that out of the way, let&#8217;s discuss the dos and don&#8217;ts of successful braking.</p>
+<ul>
+    <li><strong>Do&#8230; reduce the stop and go grind.</strong> The more city driving, the more stop and go, the quicker the brakes wear down. Simple as that. This type of driving can wear brake pads down faster, which can warp rotors more quickly. If you constantly drive like this, take your car in for at least one brake inspection a year to check for problems.
+    </li>
+    <li><strong>Do not&#8230; join the Brake Riders Brigade.</strong> Know someone with their foot riding the brake, even when no braking is necessary&#63; Don&#8217;t we all. Riding your brake is the sure&#45;fire way to wear your pads and warp your rotors from the excessive heat generated, especially at high speeds.
+    </li>
+    <li><strong>Do&#8230; cruise with the pace of traffic.</strong> Obeying speed limits with conservative driving pays off by preserving the life of your brake parts. So don&#8217;t tailgate, leave enough room to decelerate and you&#8217;ll be all set. Doing so will generate less heat, friction and wear. It&#8217;s a win&#45;win for both the pads and the rotors.
+    </li>
+    <li><strong>Do not&#8230; champion your aggressive habits.</strong> Aggressive driving leads to last minute braking. The result&#63; Excessive heat cooking your rotors. Continue driving this way and you&#8217;ll continue to pay more for the brake damage that ensues. Think about how you can avoid this driving scenario and you just might save more than just your brakes.
+    </li>
+    <li><strong>Do&#8230; empty your trunk of any heavy junk.</strong> Overloading your vehicle with things you don&#8217;t need &#8212; such as that heavy portable grill &#8212; can greatly impact brake life due to the extra weight you&#8217;re adding to your vehicle. Take stock of what&#8217;s in your trunk. Remove what you don&#8217;t need. This should improve your stopping power and eliminate the added stress and weight you&#8217;re placing on your rotors and other braking parts.
+    </li>
+</ul>
+<h3>Can you tell me the life expectancy of the rotors, brakes, pads, calipers, etc. you install&#63;</h3>
+<p>Life expectancy is universal in all walks of life. Just as health and habits can affect the length of your own life, driving habits will determine the life expectancy of your brake parts.</p>
+<ul>
+    <li><strong>The hard parts are built for endurance&#58;</strong> Rotors and calipers can last for years if you follow the recommended maintenance. But beware&#58; letting your brake pads wear down completely will only damage your rotors more quickly and lead to more expensive repairs.
+    </li>
+    <li><strong>Time is on your side.</strong> Calipers are usually designed for the long haul, but their biggest enemies are heat and corrosion. Improper maintenance can create caliper corrosion and leaks caused by constant stop and go, worn pads and metal on metal grinding. Road salt and weather can lead to corrosion as well. So schedule an annual brake inspection, and we&#8217;ll provide a clearer picture on their current condition. See your vehicle&#8217;s owner&#8217;s manual for recommended maintenance.
+    </li>
+    <li><strong>It&#8217;s all a balancing act.</strong> If your suspension system&#8217;s shocks and struts are off balance, you&#8217;ve probably noticed a significant shift in your ride&#8217;s weight distribution. You&#8217;ll be able to gauge this if you can feel the front end nose dive after you brake. The distance it takes to stop is also longer, causing your front brakes to wear out faster.
+    </li>
+    <li><strong>The Pulling Effect&#58;</strong> If your car pulls to the left or right when applying your brakes, this may indicate your brakes or suspension are functioning poorly and are in need of inspection.
+    </li>
+</ul>
+<p>Experiencing any of these braking symptoms&#63; We have the cure. <a href="/appointment/">Find your brake hero</a>.</p>]]>

+        <h2>Technicians &#38; Process</h2>
+        <h3>How do Firestone Complete Auto Care technicians inspect brakes&#63;</h3>
+<p>Our Free Brake Inspection is as thorough as the day is long. Just ask for it and you shall receive. Our techs can detect most any brake problem, big or small, by inspecting your ride&#8217;s different brake components. We have over 5,000 ASE certified brake technicians, the most in the auto repair industry. This ensures you have a knowledgeable and professional brake technician working on your vehicle.</p>
+<h3>What specialty training do your expert brake technicians undergo&#63; What is ASE Certification&#63;</h3>
+<p>You wouldn&#8217;t see a doctor who&#8217;s not an M.D., so we believe the same discretion applies to the person who repairs your brakes. To become a brake expert requires expert training and the drive to excel in auto care. Here at Firestone Complete Auto Care, we employ over 5,000 <abbr title="Auto Service Excellence">ASE</abbr> (Auto Service Excellence) certified technicians, the most in the industry. ASE is the automotive industry standard with a trusted certification process. For us, ASE is our way of ensuring that qualified and knowledgeable expert technicians are working on your automobile.</p>
+<h3>What do your ASE certified brake techs have to do to become brake specialist certified&#63;</h3>
+<p>Before any brake technician can even become ASE brake certified, they&#8217;re required to have two years of automotive experience.</p>
+<p>The Brake Specialist exam is one of over 50 different exams ASE offers. It is a rigorous test and the standard way to accurately measure the competency and knowledge of the technician seeking certification. </p>
+<p>Now the next time you see the ASE patch on one of our tech&#8217;s uniform, you&#8217;ll know you have a qualified person at the helm. Certification is not for life. To remain certified, ASE brake specialists must be retested every five years.</p>
+<p><a href="http://www.ase.com/" rel="external nofollow">Learn more at about ASE Certification</a></p>
+<h3>What is MAP&#63;</h3>
+<p><abbr title="Motorist Assurance Program">MAP</abbr> stands for the Motorist Assurance Program. It&#8217;s the consumer outreach program enacted by the Automotive Maintenance and Repair Association, Inc. &#40;AMRA&#41; and is a nationally recognized quality assurance program with participation by the industry&#8217;s leading retailers, suppliers, independent repair facilities, and vehicle manufacturers.</p>
+<p>To strengthen the relationship between consumers and auto repair facilities, MAP was started in 1994 to ensure the consumer always receives honest and detailed information regarding their vehicle parts&#59; all in the name of helping the consumer educate themselves on their vehicle while providing the most trusted and consistent recommendations about each vehicle part we&#8217;ve inspected.</p>
+<p>We&#8217;ve been a strong advocate of quality service. MAP is our way of ensuring to you that your car is in good hands at any and all Firestone Complete Auto Care stores. MAP is always being updated with the help of government and state officials to address new developments in the automotive industry.</p>
+<h3>What do the Red, Yellow and Green color codes mean on the inspection form&#63;</h3>
+<p>Understanding the color code is as easy as understanding every driver&#8217;s favorite frienemy, the traffic light. But first, to give you a little clarification, the color code system was enacted in 1994 by the Motorist Assurance Program &#40;MAP&#41; to create consistent standards for recommending and selling parts and services to consumers. We not only follow industry standards at Firestone Complete Auto Care, we also abide by our own quality standards.</p>
+<p>Using the traffic light model, we can precisely classify the wear on your parts&#58;</p>
+<ul>
+    <li><strong>Red&#58;</strong> A red mark on a particular part requires repair or replacement. If the part needs adjustment, such as relating to an alignment issue, this means we can repair the issue. Most of the time however, red means the part is no longer performing its intended purpose or it no longer meets the design specs. In both instances, you will be told the part needs to be replaced in order for your car to operate under mandated vehicle specifications. If a part is missing, a red mark will also be used to indicate replacement needed.
+    </li>
+    <li><strong>Yellow&#58;</strong> Though your vehicle can function with the particular part&#40;s&#41; in the yellow zone, we typically suggest repair or replacement to avoid the red zone scenario. Some yellow lights you can make it through, others turn red before you know it. A yellow mark could mean the part is close to the end of useful life. We refer to the manufacturer&#8217;s recommended action based on your vehicle&#8217;s original equipment manufacturer specifications. Your technician will also provide a recommendation based on their experience and knowledge of the part in question on your particular vehicle.
+    </li>
+    <li><strong>Green&#58;</strong> Everybody&#8217;s favorite color upon approaching any intersection. It&#8217;s also our favorite color to check off in relation to your car parts. If you receive this mark, give yourself a pat on the back, and rest easy knowing the checked parts passed our inspection and you&#8217;re good to go.

+<![CDATA[<p>Knowledge is power when it comes to your car&#8217;s battery and electrical system. In fact, it&#8217;s your ride&#8217;s heart and soul. The last thing you want is to be left stranded with a dead battery. The more you know about your battery and electrical system, the less likely you&#8217;ll get stuck. At Firestone Complete Auto Care, we&#8217;re here to help you understand just what&#8217;s going on with your vehicle&#8217;s battery and electrical system.</p>
+<p>On average, a battery will last 3 to 5 years, but driving habits and exposure to extreme elements can shorten the life of your car battery. At Firestone Complete Auto Care, we offer a free battery check&#45;up with every visit to our store. This is a quick diagnostic check to estimate the temperature at which your battery may fail. It also gives you some idea how much battery life you have left. One little test tells you if your battery is good to go.</p>
+        <h2>Battery Knowledge</h2>
+        <h3>How exactly does a car battery work&#63;</h3>
+<p>The car battery provides the jolt of electricity necessary to power all the electrical components in your vehicle. Talk about a pretty huge responsibility. Without battery power, your car, as you&#8217;ve probably noticed, won&#8217;t start.</p>
+<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at how that powerful little box works&#58;</p>
+<ul>
+    <li>A chemical reaction puts your car in action&#58; Your battery converts chemical energy into the electrical energy necessary to power your car, delivering voltage to the starter.</li>
+    <li>Keep the electric current steady&#58; Not only does your battery provide the energy required to start your car, it&#8217;s also stabilizing the voltage &#40;that&#8217;s the term for the energy supply&#41; in order to keep your engine running. A lot&#8217;s riding on the battery. Call it the &#8216;little box that could.&#8217;</li>
+</ul>
+<p>The car battery may be small, but the power it provides is huge. Test your battery now with our <a href="/auto-services/batteries/virtual-battery-tester">Virtual Battery Tester</a>.</p>
+<p><a href="/auto-services/batteries/">Find the right Interstate Battery</a> for your specific vehicle, at the right price &#8212; right now.</p>
+<h3>How do Interstate batteries compare to other car battery brands&#63;</h3>
+<p>We stock these quality brand batteries &#8212; and install them too.</p>
+<ul>
+    <li>Manufactured by Johnson Controls&#58; the world leader in battery quality with 80&#43; years of innovation.</li>
+    <li>Interstate is &#35;1&#58; Interstate Batteries are the &#35;1 automotive replacement batteries in America with 15 million batteries sold every year &#8211; the quality and reliability is in the numbers.</li>
+</ul>
+    <h2>Symptoms &#38; Procedures</h2>
+    <h3>Are there any warning signs that may indicate my battery is on the fritz&#63;</h3>
+<p>&#8220;If I only knew sooner.&#8221; We&#8217;ve all been there before. Fortunately, there are various indications and symptoms that your battery may need replacement&#58;</p>
+<ol>
+    <li>Slow engine crank&#58; When you attempt to start the vehicle, the cranking of the engine is sluggish and takes longer than normal to start. You&#8217;d best describe it as the &quot;rur rur rur&quot; starting noise sound.</li>
+    <li>Check engine light&#58; The check engine light sometimes appears when your battery power is weak. Strange system indicator lights&#8211;such as check engine and low coolant lights&#8211;could mean there&#8217;s a problem with your battery. &#40;It could also just mean you need more coolant&#41;.</li>
+    <li>
+    Low battery fluid level&#58; Car batteries typically have a part of the casing that&#8217;s translucent so you can always keep an eye on your battery&#8217;s fluid level. You can also inspect it by removing the red and black caps if they are not sealed &#40;most modern car batteries now permanently seal these parts&#41;.
+    <ul>
+            <li>Bottom line&#58; If the fluid level is below the lead plates &#40;energy conductor&#41; inside, it&#8217;s time to have the battery and charging system tested. When fluid levels drop, it&#8217;s typically caused by overcharging &#40;heat&#41;.</li>
+    </ul>
+    </li>
+    <li>The swelling, bloating battery case&#58; If your battery casing looks like it ate a very large meal, this could indicate a battery gone bad. You can blame excessive heat for causing your battery case to swell, decreasing your battery life.</li>
+    <li>Eww, there&#8217;s a stinky, rotten egg smell&#58; You may notice a pungent, rotten egg smell &#40;sulfur odor&#41; around the battery. The cause&#58; Battery leaks. Leaking also causes the corrosion around the posts &#40;where the &#43; and &#8211; cable connections are located.&#41; The gunk may need to be removed or your car may not start.</li>
+    <li>Three years &#43; battery age is considered an old timer&#58; Your battery can last well beyond three years but, at the very least, have its current condition inspected on a yearly basis when it reaches the three year mark. Battery life cycles range from three&#45;to&#45;five years depending on the battery. However, driving habits, weather and frequent short trips &#40;under 20 minutes&#41; can drastically shorten the actual life of your car battery.</li>
+</ol>
+<h3>How do I determine if my battery is too old&#63;</h3>
+<p>For one thing, you can check the four&#45; or five&#45;digit date code on the cover of your battery case. The first part of the code is key&#58; look for the letter and digit. A letter is assigned to each month &#8212; you know, like A for January, B for February and so on. The number that follows nods to the year, as in 9 for 2009 and 1 for 2011. This code tells you when the battery was shipped from the factory to our local Interstate Battery wholesale distributor. The additional digits tell where the battery was made. Car batteries last, on average, three&#45; to&#45;five years. Mind you, there are also weak battery signs to watch for, like a slow engine crank of low fluid level. If your battery case is swollen or bloated, there&#8217;s a smelly rotten egg scent coming from the battery or your check engine light appears, trouble may be beyond the bend. And if it&#8217;s over three years old? Consider it time for close monitoring. That&#8217;s what we&#8217;re here for.</p>

+</ul>
+    <h2>Electrical Systems</h2>
+    <h3>Can a bad battery harm the charging system or starter&#63;</h3>
+<p>You bet. If you have a weak ankle, you tend to overcompensate and put more weight&#8211;and stress&#8211;on the healthy ankle. Same concept with a weak battery. When you have a weak battery, your car ends up putting additional stress on healthy parts. The charging system, starter motor or starter solenoid can be affected.</p>
+<p>These parts can malfunction because they&#8217;re drawing excessive voltage to compensate for the lack of battery power. Leave this problem unresolved, and you could wind up replacing expensive electrical parts&#8211;typically without warning.</p>
+<p><strong>Quick Tip&#58;</strong> Our Electrical System Check makes sure all the necessary parts are drawing the correct voltage. We&#8217;ll know right away if there&#8217;s any weak parts that may need immediate replacement. Don&#8217;t leave your car&#8217;s power to chance, you may end up paying for it later.</p>
+<h3>How do you know if your alternator isn&#8217;t giving your battery enough electricity&#63;</h3>      
+<p>Let&#8217;s just say we&#8217;re clairvoyant.</p>
+<p>All joking aside, let&#8217;s start with the obvious symptoms&#58;</p>
+<ul>
+    <li>The electrical system is possessed. Strange flickering lights or warning lights such as &#8217;Check Engine&#8217; flicker, disappear, and then reappear again. All these malfunctions usually start occurring when the car battery is nearly drained and struggling to provide power. If the alternator is faulty, your battery will no longer receive a charge and is moments away from being totally kaput.</li>
+    <li>The Slow Crank. You&#8217;re starting your car, and it keeps turning and turning, eventually starting&#8211;or not. This could mean your alternator isn&#8217;t charging your battery properly. If you start experiencing the possessed electrical system as well, please stop in to the nearest service facility. Your car could be moments away from a dead battery and alternator.</li>
+</ul>
+<p><strong>Let&#8217;s review&#58;</strong> All the above happens when the battery is not receiving a charge &#40;due to a faulty alternator&#41;. Your battery will continue to drain. When it drains completely&#8230;well, we all know what happens next&#58; curbed car. And neither you, nor us, want you to go through that.</p>
+<p><strong>Quick tip&#58;</strong> The sooner we can inspect your vehicle, the less likely you&#8217;ll face every drivers&#8217; biggest fear&#8211;a car that won&#8217;t start. Drive with peace of mind.</p>

+<h2>The jolt your ride needs to ride on.</h2>
+<p>Powering your ride is a complex affair. But here&#8217;s a straightforward fact&#58; you need a functioning battery to make it go. After all, without battery power, your car won&#8217;t start. Your car battery provides the zap of electricity needed to put electrical components to work. It also converts chemical energy into the electrical energy that powers your car and delivers voltage to its starter. And it stabilizes the voltage &#40;a.k.a. energy supply&#41; that keeps your engine running. Important, indeed.</p>

+<![CDATA[<h2>Quick Tips&#58; Maintenance</h2>
+<ol class="reduced">
+ <li>
+  <h3>Tip 01</h3>
+  <p>
+   <strong>Backup power and connectors&#58;</strong><br />
+   Lights off &#47; accessories unplugged. All it takes is one light left on overnight or accessories plugged in while your car is off and guess what&#63; Your battery is dead before you know it. If it&#8217;s too late, make sure you have jumper cables on hand, or better yet, a self&#45;powering car battery jumper in your trunk.
+  </p>
+ </li>
+ <li>
+  <h3>Tip 02</h3>
+  <p>
+   <strong>Conserve energy&#58;</strong><br />
+   &#8220;Just say no&#8221; to short trip after short trip. Your battery requires time to charge. If you take frequent short trips, this can result in inconstistent charge levels and&#47;or a drained battery.
+  </p>
+ </li>
+ <li>
+  <h3>Tip 03</h3>
+  <p>
+   <strong>Professional maintenance&#58;</strong><br />
+   Failure is not an option. Always have a qualified professional inspecting your electrical systems. We offer a full electrical system check and have certified <abbr title="National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence">ASE</abbr> technicians on staff.
+  </p>
+ </li>
+ <li>
+  <h3>Tip 04</h3>
+  <p>
+   <strong>Keep it cool&#58;</strong><br />
+   Parking in cooler locations &#40;covered garages&#41; in hotter climates can help, but your best bet is to have your battery tested, at the very least, before summer. Prepare for the worst and you may just avoid it altogether. That&#8217;s a win&#45;win situation there.
+  </p>
+ </li>
+ <li>
+  <h3>Tip 05</h3>
+  <p>
+   <strong>Clean it up&#58;</strong><br />
+   Make sure your vehicle&#8217;s battery terminals are kept clean and free of corrosion.
+  </p>
+ </li>
+ <li>
+  <h3>Tip 06</h3>
+  <p>
+   <strong>Timely up&#45;keep&#58;</strong><br />
+   Always have a qualified professional maintain your electrical system and make sure to have quality replacement parts installed when existing electrical system parts fail.
+  </p>
+ </li>
+</ol>
+<h2>Quick Tips&#58; Jumping a Battery</h2>
+<ol class="reduced">
+ <li>
+  <h3>Tip 01</h3>
+  <p>Never connect the black cable to the negative &#40;&#8211;&#41; terminal on your dead battery. This is very dangerous, as it could result in an explosion.</p>
+ </li>
+ <li>
+  <h3>Tip 02</h3>
+  <p>Make sure you follow the instructions in your owner&#8217;s manual when jump starting your vehicle. Every car is different. Trust us. We&#8217;re experts.</p>
+ </li>
+</ol>
+<p><strong>Warning&#58;</strong> Do not, under any circumstance, attempt to connect loose wires. Unless you are a certified technician, leave the dangerous stuff to us. If you mishandle the wiring, it&#8217;s very easy to short out expensive computer components and put yourself in harm&#8217;s way.</p>
+<h2>Top Questions and Answers.</h2>
+<h3>How do I jump start a battery&#63;</h3>
+<p>Believe it or not, today&#8217;s vehicles have various methods for jump starting car batteries. It&#8217;s no longer just a simple &#8220;connect this cable here and that one there&#8221; scenario.</p>
+<p>Please refer to your owner&#8217;s manual for instructions relating to jump starting your specific vehicle. Many vehicles have crucial steps that must be followed precisely so you can protect your electrical system and have a successful jump.</p>
+<p>If you&#8217;re still experiencing issues with your battery, stop in to any of <a href="/appointment/">our locations</a> for a battery test, and we&#8217;ll get your car back up and running in no time.</p>
+<h3>Why can&#8217;t you connect the black jumper cable to the dead battery&#8217;s negative &#40;&#8211;&#41; terminal&#63;</h3>
+<p>Oh, you know, to avoid explosions and what not. Bet you didn&#8217;t think a dead battery could create that, huh&#63;</p>
+<p>Typically, when a person jump starts a car, sparks can occur. That&#8217;s why it is recommended that you connect the negative jumper cable to the vehicle body and not the negative post of the battery. This is so you can avoid sparks from occurring near the battery where flammable hydrogen gas may be present, resulting in a possible explosion.</p>
+<h4>Quick Tip&#58;</h4>
+<ul>
+ <li>Never connect the black cable to the negative &#40;&#8211;&#41; terminal on your dead battery. This is very dangerous, could result in a possible explosion.</li>
+ <li>Make sure you follow the instructions in your owner&#8217;s manual when jump starting your vehicle. Every car is different. Trust us. We&#8217;re experts.</li>

+<content>
+<![CDATA[<p>Your car&#8217;s electrical system consists of the battery, starter and alternator. The battery provides juice to the starter. Then, the alternator gives that battery the energy it needs to power your car. If one of these parts is not working properly, your car won&#8217;t start or run correctly. Our expert technicians can perform an electrical system check to ensure everything is working properly. It pinpoints any problems that may occur with your electrical system. If our technicians find a problem, they&#8217;ll let you know what they can do to fix it. We can curb any problem before it starts, so you won&#8217;t be left stranded with a non&#45;starting vehicle.</p>
+<h2>Battery</h2>
+<p>Until your vehicle starts, your battery is providing the car&#8217;s entire electrical current. This includes the current to the ignition and fuel systems, which are responsible for creating the combustion necessary for your engine to function.</p>
+<h2>Starter</h2>
+<p>While the battery supplies the power to start your vehicle, the starter is really what gets the engine going. The battery supplies a small amount of power to the starter motor. The starter then rotates the flywheel, which turns the crankshaft and begins the movement of the engine&#8217;s pistons. This intricate process is why it&#8217;s key to make sure the starter works.</p>
+<p>It&#8217;s difficult to determine when a starter will fail exactly, but an electrical system check at Firestone Complete Auto Care can help recognize the warning signs. We check if the starter is drawing the proper amount of current. An excessive current draw will indicate a worn starter, while a low current draw points to corroded cables or connections. Not to worry&#33; This is a problem our expert technicians can fix.</p>
+<h2>Alternator</h2>
+<p>When your engine is running, the alternator keeps the battery charged and the electrical system going. Your car can start with a faulty alternator, but it won&#8217;t be able to run for an extended period of time. If the alternator requires replacement, your vehicle&#8217;s electrical system will perform erratically, its battery will discharge, and eventually your engine will lose power. A complete electrical system check from Firestone Complete Auto Care will tell you whether the alternator is generating the proper amount of current and voltage. That way, you have a heads up before your alternator fails.</p>
+<h2>See It in Action</h2>
+<p>So you turn the key and your vehicle&#8217;s electrical system goes into action. The battery provides juice to the starter, the starter turns and the alternator gives the battery the energy it needs to power your lights, defroster, wipers and accessories. See how it works&#58;</p>
+<figure class="figure-electrical-system">
+        <img src="/static-fcac/images/cf/articles/electrical-system.jpg" alt="Electrical System Illustration" />
+</figure>
+<h2>A healthy electrical system. For a reliable ride.</h2>
+<p>Your car&#8217;s electrical system is important. Really important. So is staying informed about its ability to perform. Left unchecked, a weak or dead battery can wreak havoc on other electrical system parts, like alternators and starters. If your electrical system is showing signs of acting up &#40;<a href="/cf/batteries/car-battery-problems-when-is-it-time-for-a-new-battery/">see symptoms here</a>&#41;, don&#8217;t delay. Bring your car to your local Firestone Complete Auto Care so they can assess the situation, make sure voltage is correct and prevent further potential damage. You don&#8217;t want failure be an option, ever.</p>

+    <h2>Top Questions and Answers.</h2>
+    <h3>How could a battery drain overnight&#63;</h3>
+<p>Batteries can do a lot of things while we&#8217;re not looking. The most common way a battery will drain overnight is by leaving a light on or a power adapter plugged in, zapping all your battery power while you&#8217;re fast asleep.</p>
+<p>Your battery can also drain overnight if there are faulty electrical components or wiring. If this might be the case, let us check it out so we can resolve the problem and get you rolling again.</p>

+<h3>What factors will affect the life of my car battery&#63;</h3>
+<p>So, you want to know if your battery will last three years or, better yet, five years, eh&#63; Well, that all depends on your driving habits, plus the year&#45;round climate in your area.</p>
+<ol>
+    <li>Short Trips. Shorter battery life. If you take many short trips &#40;less than 20 minutes&#41;, your battery won&#8217;t have enough time to fully recharge, shortening its overall life expectancy.</li>
+    <li>Extreme temperatures kill batteries. The dog days of summer take the biggest toll on your battery. Scorching temperatures &#8212; and even freezing temperatures &#8212; can shorten battery life. A lot of times, waiting until the deep freeze of winter to replace your battery is often too late. The cold weather could pretty much make that heat worn battery dead on arrival.</li>
+    <li>Find your region. Discover the average battery life.</li>

+<h3>What are the warning signs that my alternator is failing&#63;</h3>
+<p>&#8220;If I only knew sooner&#8221;. We&#8217;ve all been there before. Fortunately, there are various indications and symptoms that your battery may need replacement&#58;</p>
+<ol>
+    <li>Slow engine crank&#58; When you attempt to start the vehicle, the cranking of the engine is sluggish and takes longer than normal to start. You&#8217;d best describe it as the &#8220;rur rur rur&#8221; starting noise sound.</li>
+    <li>Check engine light&#58; The check engine light sometimes appears when your battery power is weak. Strange system indicator lights &#8211; such as check engine and low coolant lights &#8211; could mean there&#8217;s a problem with your battery. &#40;It could also just mean you need more coolant&#41;.</li>
+    <li>
+    Low battery fluid level&#58; Car batteries typically have a part of the casing that&#8217;s translucent so you can always keep an eye on your battery&#8217;s fluid level. You can also inspect it by removing the red and black caps if they are not sealed &#40;most modern car batteries now permanently seal these parts&#41;.
+    <ul>
+            <li>Bottom line&#58; If the fluid level is below the lead plates &#40;energy conductor&#41; inside, it&#8217;s time to have the battery and charging system tested. When fluid levels drop, it&#8217;s typically caused by overcharging &#40;heat&#41;.</li>
+    </ul>
+    </li>
+    <li>The swelling, bloating battery case&#58; If your battery casing looks like it ate a very large meal, this could indicate a battery gone bad. You can blame excessive heat for causing your battery case to swell, decreasing your battery life.</li>
+    <li>Eww, there&#8217;s a stinky, rotten egg smell&#58; You may notice a pungent, rotten egg smell &#40;sulfur odor&#58;&#41; around the battery. The cause&#58; Battery leaks. Leaking also causes the corrosion around the posts &#40;where the &#40;&#43;&#41; and &#40;&#8211;&#41; cable connections are located.&#41; The gunk may need to be removed; otherwise, your car may not start.</li>
+    <li>Three years &#43; battery age is considered an old timer&#58; Your battery can last well beyond three years but, at the very least, have its current condition inspected on a yearly basis when it reaches the three year mark. Battery life cycles range from three&#45;to&#45;five years depending on the battery. However, driving habits, weather and frequent short trips &#40;under 20 minutes&#41; can drastically shorten the actual life of your car battery.</li>

+<![CDATA[<h2>How Your Battery Works</h2>
+<p>Your vehicle&#8217;s battery is considered the heart of its electrical system. Your battery converts chemical energy into electrical energy to make your car run. Not only does your battery provide energy to start your car, it also helps stabilize voltage to keep your engine running. When your battery is low on juice or its cables or terminals are loose, your car won&#8217;t start. Unfortunately, your vehicle doesn&#8217;t always give you warning signs that your battery is about to die. However, there are some ways to keep your battery running newer, longer.</p>
+<ul>
+    <li>Avoid leaving on lights and accessories when the engine is not running &#8212; this will drain your battery.</li>
+    <li>Take fewer short trips to prevent inconsistent battery charge levels.</li>
+    <li>Make sure your vehicle&#8217;s battery terminals are kept clean and free of corrosion.</li>
+    <li>Always have a qualified professional maintain your electrical systems.</li>
+    <li>Have quality replacement parts installed when existing electrical system parts fail.</li>
+</ul>
+<p>The last thing you need is for your battery to unexpectedly fail. We&#8217;ll check it before that happens, so you don&#8217;t get stuck. Our techs can give your battery a free check&#45;up the next time you bring your vehicle in for maintenance, tires or other repairs. This quick test lets you know if your battery is providing adequate power and at what temperature it could potentially fail.</p>
+<p>When your engine is running, the alternator keeps the battery charged and the electrical system going. Your car can start with a faulty alternator, but it won&#8217;t be able to run for an extended period of time. If the alternator requires replacement, your vehicle&#8217;s electrical system will perform erratically, its battery will discharge, and eventually your engine will lose power. A complete electrical system check from Firestone Complete Auto Care will tell you whether the alternator is generating the proper amount of current and voltage, to let you know before your alternator fails.</p>
+<img src="/static-fcac/images/cf/articles/battery-life-expectancy-zone.jpg" class="right" alt="Battery Life Expectancy Zone" />
+<h2>A Battery&#8217;s Life is Influenced by Your Climate</h2>
+<p>This map gives an indication of how long a car battery should last in different climates. Use the image to determine how long your battery should generally last. Other factors affect battery quality as well; for instance, driving less than 20 minutes doesn&#8217;t give your battery a chance to recharge. Driving habits, extreme temperatures and bad maintenance techniques can quickly drain your battery&#8217;s charge. This makes it more difficult to determine how long a battery will last, and all factors must be considered.</p>
+<p>Try our <a href="/auto-services/batteries/virtual-battery-tester">Virtual Battery Tester</a> to get an idea of how long your original equipment battery might last. If your battery is near the end of its estimated life, Firestone Complete Auto Care offers a variety of Interstate Batteries to fit your vehicle.</p>
+<h2>Car Battery Clarity. Never a Mystery.</h2>
+<p>Some things in life leave you stumped. But there&#8217;s no reason your car battery has to be one of them. Check out our frequently asked questions and become a battery buff. Of course, Firestone Complete Auto Care technicians can help as well &#8212; they know what to do when yours is on its last leg.

+<![CDATA[
+        <h2>Alignment Basics</h2>
+        <h3>Why is a wheel alignment so important&#63;</h3>
+<p>Picture yourself cruising down the most beautiful road in the world. Now imagine driving down that same road with your wheels pointing the wrong way. Not the most beautiful road in the world anymore.</p>
+<p>Alignment is a really complex topic covering a variety of terms and a smorgasbord of parts. When your wheels are out of alignment, your tires aren&#8217;t pointing in the right direction. This will affect your steering and suspension, but more importantly, it could affect your safety and the durability of your tires and all the parts controlling them.</p>
+<p>Firestone Complete Auto Care has all the <a href="/repair/alignment.jsp">services for your alignment needs</a>.</p>
+<p>Ready for your perfect alignment&#63; <a href="/appointment/">So are we</a>.</p>
+<h3>How do vehicles lose their wheel alignment&#63;</h3>
+<p>It doesn&#8217;t take much, that&#8217;s for sure. There are many ways for your car to lose its alignment. You&#8217;ll be familiar with most of the causes, but what you probably didn&#8217;t think was that each one could do quite a number on your vehicle&#8217;s alignment. </p>
+<p>Wheel alignment can be thrown off by&#58;</p>
+<ul>
+    <li>Pot holes</li>
+    <li>Hitting the curb</li>
+    <li>Bumping into concrete parking stalls</li>
+    <li>Fair wear and tear &#8212; as vehicles age, rubber components start cracking or lose their elasticity and ball and socket joints develop looseness. They start to give a little more, progressively getting slightly worse over time.</li>
+</ul>
+<p>Alignment angles are measured in tenths and hundredths of degrees or inches. Over time, a slight misalignment can cause a lot of uneven or premature tire wear. Put your next alignment in the hands of an alignment pro. <a href="/appointment/">Call us today</a>.</p>
+<h3>What happens if I don&#8217;t get my wheels aligned&#63;</h3>
+<p>We cringe just thinking of someone never having an alignment performed on his or her vehicle. What will ultimately end up happening is you&#8217;ll throw a lot of money down the drain on tires because, with out proper alignment, tires wear down a lot faster. Simple as that. And you&#8217;ll most likely notice something&#8217;s wrong while you&#8217;re driving; your vehicle will probably not handle as well as it should and, in the most extreme cases, you could have a pretty difficult time maintaining control of your ride altogether. All this bad news is, fortunately for you, easily preventable by having your wheels aligned when needed.</p>
+<p><strong>Did you know&#63;</strong> The smartest move is to have your alignment checked every other oil change. Doing so will make your tires last longer.</p>
+<p><strong>Quick Tip&#58;</strong> If your vehicle needs an alignment, ask for a Lifetime Alignment. With this service we&#8217;ll align your tires every 6,000 miles or when requested for as long as you own your ride.</p>
+<h3>How often should I have my alignment checked&#63;</h3>
+<p>Long live longer tire life. We recommend an Alignment Check with every other oil change. A lot happens over the course of 6,000 miles. You drive through pot holes, travel down gravely stretches of road, or worse, knock your wheels on the curb while making a turn. All these things can impact the way your tires sit, throwing off alignment in an instant. </p>
+<p><strong>Did you know&#63;</strong> The longer you wait for an alignment, the more damage that can occur. You&#8217;d be surprised. If it&#8217;s been awhile since your last alignment, it&#8217;s time for a checkup.</p>
+<h3>Do vehicles have different types of alignment specifications&#63;</h3>
+<p>Every model that rolls off the assembly line has unique alignment specifications. Alignment specs are determined by the vehicle manufacturer for each make and model. The size, length, weight and intended use of the vehicle all play a role in the determining the correct alignment angles.</p>
+<p><strong>Did you know&#63;</strong> We use a special computerized alignment machine pre&#45;loaded with every vehicle&#8217;s alignment specifications. Once the vehicle type is determined, the high tech and precise measuring begins. Upon completion, you&#8217;ll receive a print out displaying the vehicle manufacturer&#8217;s alignment angle specifications, what your angles are before adjustments were made and where it stands after adjustments are made. At Firestone Complete Auto Care, we provide alignments for most any vehicle using this special equipment.</p>
+<h3>Why is it so hard to determine if my car&#8217;s alignment is off&#63;</h3>
+<p>It&#8217;s not you, it&#8217;s your eyes. We mere humans can&#8217;t see in fractions of degrees without technology. It only takes a minuscule amount of misalignment to have a huge impact on tire life. So, signs and symptoms of poor wheel alignment, unfortunately, aren&#8217;t always right there staring you in face.</p>
+<h3>How are alignments different today&#63;</h3>
+<p>Alignments aren&#8217;t different per se, but vehicles are more advanced and precise now than ever before. And at today&#8217;s prices we expect more from our rides, that&#8217;s for sure. Let&#8217;s just say a lot has changed since dad was driving that Oldsmobile. As a result, maintaining the ride and performance that modern vehicles are capable of, a proper alignment must take into account where the rear wheels are pointed.</p>
+<p>There&#8217;s more vehicle variety on the road these days, too. Vehicles have different purposes. Some have rear steering capabilities. Some have stability controls or dynamic stability controls or active stability management or SAS &#40;Steering Angle Sensors&#41;. Every car manufacturer is different and requires different methods to adjust each unique system.</p>

+    <h2>Symptoms &#38; Solutions</h2>
+    <h3>How do driving conditions affect my vehicle&#8217;s wheel alignment&#63;</h3>
+<p>Bad roads can be your wheels&#8217; worst enemy. If you drive down poorly maintained roads, drive through pot holes, or even hit a curb, your alignment can be greatly affected.</p>
+<p>This can cause even the slightest, tiniest alignment issue, which can accelerate uneven tire wear. Make sure you have your alignment checked every 6,000 miles or so. Your tires and your wallet will thank you later.</p>
+<p>Have alignment questions&#63; Need to schedule an Alignment Check&#63; <a href="/appointment/">Call us</a>.</p>
+<h3>How will a wheel alignment help my vehicle&#63;</h3>
+<p><strong>Repeat after us&#58; A wheel alignment ensures optimal drivability</strong>. It will help your tires last longer, your vehicle drive smoother, ultimately keeping your wheels pointed in the right direction. And, when it drives more smoothly, it&#8217;s smooth sailing &#8212; or should we say cruising &#8212; ahead. Plus, your car will require less energy to keep going, potentially saving a ton of fuel depending on how much alignment was required.</p>
+<p>When your car rolled off the manufacturer assembly line, it came preset with special angles that position your tires correctly. And for good reason.  In order for your vehicle to travel the way it&#8217;s supposed to, it will need precise alignment. Mis&#45;alignment can lead to uneven tire wear, poor handling and shorter tire life. Tires are expensive. Keeping them aligned isn&#8217;t.</p>

+<p>Nope. Sorry. Regular checkups are a good defense though.</p>
+<h3>What does tire wear mean to my car&#8217;s alignment&#63;</h3>
+<p>The name of the poor alignment game is uneven tire wear. Ideally, tires should wear evenly across the tread. If you&#8217;re noticing excessive wear on the rear inside tires, you may have too much junk in the trunk or need an alignment adjustment. Uneven tire wear can also result in less MPGs and more pain at the gas pump.</p>
+<p><strong>Quick Fact&#58;</strong> Poor alignment can shorten a tire&#8217;s life by thousands of miles and compromise very crucial steering and suspension parts. That&#8217;s a big hit to the wallet. If you don&#8217;t want to replace tires as often and enjoy the benefits of better fuel economy, have your alignment checked, at the very least, with every other oil change or at the first sign of uneven or premature tire wear.</p>
+<h3>How can I tell if my car&#8217;s alignment is off&#63;</h3>
+<p>There are some noticeable signs that could indicate a misalignment. Just use your eyes, ears and hands. Your senses &#40;and even the good old personal hunch&#41; are good human capital for spotting poor alignment. Here are some common signs that you are dealing with wheels with poor alignment&#58;</p>
+<ul>
+    <li>Vehicle pulling to the left or right</li>
+    <li>Uneven or rapid tire wear</li>
+    <li>Your steering wheel is crooked when driving straight</li>
+    <li>Squealing tires</li>
+</ul>
+<p>Noticing any of these alignment issues&#63; Let&#8217;s get your ride pointing in the right direction again. <a href="/appointment/">Schedule an Alignment Check</a>.</p>
+<p><strong>Quick Tip&#58;</strong> If you are unsure about your current alignment, please give us a call. Tire misalignment can be so subtle, you may not even realize it. Luckily for your wheels, we have the precision equipment and expertise to check your alignment and fix it if needed.</p>
+<h3>What are some misalignment issues I can remedy myself&#63;</h3>
+<p>Looks like we&#8217;ve got an avid problem solver in the house. Well, let&#8217;s put your skills to work and do some solving. Even if everything feels right, and no symptoms are present, there are some more alignment issues that you can remedy yourself.</p>
+<p>Try these out&#58;</p>
+<ul>
+    <li>Remove junk from your trunk Alignment is based on tire angles, which go hand-in-hand with vehicle chassis height.  If you have too much weight loading down your back end, that lowers your vehicle height, throwing off your alignment. Remove what you don&#8217;t need, and make sure to have your alignment check since your alignment can&#8217;t adjust itself.</li>
+    <li>Maintain correct air pressure in your tires</li>
+    <li>Embrace conservative driving.  It will place less strain on steering and suspension components which are key to maintaining proper alignment.</li>

+    <h2>Our Expertise</h2>
+    <h3>What equipment do you use to calibrate my vehicle&#8217;s wheel alignment&#63;</h3>
+<p>No set of eyeballs has ever produced an accurate alignment. A successful tire alignment hinges on using advanced computerized alignment equipment. We&#8217;re talking fractions of a degree here. Undetectable to the naked eye.</p>
+<p>At Firestone Complete Auto Care, our advanced computerized alignment equipment configures to your vehicle&#8217;s camber, caster and toe specs.</p>
+<p>Our Computerized Alignment Equipment&#58;</p>
+<ul>
+    <li>Measures and sets all four tires to the settings specified by your vehicle manufacturer. Accuracy and precision of this equipment minimizes accelerated tire wear and reduced fuel economy.</li>
+    <li>Provides the most accurate reading available. Gone are the days of eyeballing wheel alignment and using tape measures and strings to set alignment angles. Our computerized alignment equipment gets the job done better and more accurately than ever before.</li>
+    <li>Knows every vehicle. Each vehicle has different specifications provided by the vehicle manufacturer. It&#8217;s all preloaded in our equipment so you get a precise alignment.</li>
+</ul>
+<p>Ready for the perfect alignment&#63; <a href="/appointment/">So are we</a>.</p>
+<p>Take advantage of our <a href="/repair/alignment.jsp">Lifetime Alignment</a> service.</p>
+                                                
+<h3>Do I need an appointment for wheel alignment&#63;</h3>
+<p>You don&#8217;t need one, but an appointment always helps. Wheel alignments aren&#8217;t an in&#45;and&#45;out service. They take precision and focus and the time needed will vary based on the current condition of your ride. If your alignment is off by even a tiny fraction of a degree, it can mean trouble for your vehicle.</p>
+<p>We&#8217;d be happy to set up a wheel alignment service time that fits your schedule and your vehicle&#8217;s needs. And, to top it all off, we&#8217;ll perform your alignment with accurate, state of the art computerized alignment equipment.</p>
+<p>Time for an Alignment Check&#63; Don&#8217;t know&#63; <a href="/appointment/">Schedule an appointment</a>.</p>
+
+<h3>How long does it take to perform an alignment&#63;</h3>
+<p>To quote the great Albert Einstein, &#8220;<q>It&#8217;s all relative.</q>&#8221; Every vehicle is different, with varying degrees of needs, making it difficult to offer a standard wait time.</p>
+<strong>There are many factors that determine how long it will take.</strong>
+<p>Wait times all depend on your vehicle type and its present condition And, with all the angles that come into play in today&#8217;s rides, each wheel could have a minimum of three alignment angles that need adjustment &#8212; caster, camber and toe. That&#8217;s potentially 12 adjustments total. That right there means an alignment is no in&#45;and&#45;out&#45;you&#45;go service. At least, if you want it done right.</p>
+<p><strong>Quick fact</strong>: If you live in the snow belt and rust has set in, even the simplest adjustments can take awhile. And, remember, misalignment of any steering or suspension angle could mean a lot of accelerated wear to your tires.</p>
+<p><a href="/appointment/">Schedule an Alignment Check</a> and get the best handling from your ride.</p>
+                                                
+<h3>Why do you only offer a thrust &#40;four&#45;wheel&#41; alignment&#63;</h3>
+<p>Vehicles are more advanced and precise than ever before. It&#8217;s only logical that we expect more from these newer, more expensive and complex vehicles. Maintaining the ride and performance demands all your wheels, not just the front wheels, are always working together, not against one another.</p>
+<p>For that to happen, modern vehicles must be properly aligned, and that now includes the back wheels &#40;thrust&#41;. Where the rear wheels are pointed will determine where the front wheels are pointed. A two wheel alignment is so last century, and with that, gone are the days of the two wheel alignment.</p>
+<p>In order to perform a proper alignment, it&#8217;s essential that we adjust the front wheels to compensate for any potential thrust angle from the back tires. It&#8217;s all about protecting your tires and preserving your ride from the damaging effects of poor alignment.</p>
+
+<h3>Why would my vehicle have to be altered to have an alignment performed&#63;</h3>
+<p>Believe it or not, some alignments are not adjustable. Some vehicles allow all 12 adjustments, but some are designed with fewer possible adjustments. In order to change non&#45;adjustable angles, off&#45;set bushings, bolts or shims may need to be installed. These modifications may vary by vehicle.</p>
+<strong>The good news&#58;</strong>
+<p>If your vehicle requires aftermarket parts to correct an out&#45;of&#45;spec alignment angle, we can do it. If there are worn parts that prevent accurately setting the alignment, we can replace them.</p>
+<h3>What wheel alignment services do you offer&#63;</h3>
+<p>We offer three alignment services to cover all your alignment needs. These are an Alignment Check, Standard Alignment and Lifetime Alignment.</p>
+<p>Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s included with each service:</p>

+     </li>
+</ol>
+<h3>What are your steering and suspension services&#63;</h3>
+<p>A Standard or Lifetime Alignment can&#8217;t always solve everything. Wouldn&#8217;t that be nice, though&#63; A part of your steering or suspension can be worn or even broken. There are a lot more parts than you think working to keep your car headed in the right direction. No matter what, we have the technicians and the parts to meet your car&#8217;s needs.</p>

+                                                
+<h3>Why does Firestone recommend other services when I just want an alignment&#63;</h3>
+<p>There&#8217;s a lot going on during a wheel alignment. Although we&#8217;ll line your tires up to the exact manufacturer specified angles, along the way, parts that ensure proper alignment can wear out and become a major issue for the drivability and continued alignment of your ride. </p>
+<p>Steering and suspension play a major role in keeping your alignment set, but if a part on your steering or suspension is worn out or broken, your alignment can&#8217;t be properly set without replacing the part.</p>

+<p>Get your tires back pointing in the right direction. <a href="/appointment/">Schedule an Alignment Check</a>.</p>
+<h3>Why don&#8217;t you offer a &#36;29.99 alignment&#63;</h3>
+<p>Ah, the ever popular, no frills alignment. Well for one, most inexpensive alignment deals don&#8217;t cover all four wheels. In the olden days, it was common to have only two tires aligned. But now, with vehicles being more precise and advanced then ever before, only aligning the front wheels is doing less than half the job.</p>
+<p><strong>Front and back tire alignment is a pretty big deal.</strong> It requires a lot of calculations. Cars today are more precise and advanced. Some have suspension and stability controls that are affected by mis&#45;alignment.  Since the front and back tires work together, they need to be aligned with each other. That&#8217;s why we use state of the art computerized alignment equipment and the trusted hands of certified techs to get the job done right.</p>
+<p><strong>Don&#8217;t buy the &#8217;half steak sandwich&#8217;</strong>&#8230; because that&#8217;s pretty much what a two wheel alignment will leave you with. Get the full alignment.  Take your car to us, and we&#8217;ll align your vehicle with state of the art computerized alignment equipment and certified techs. You paid good money for your vehicle and tires, keep your ride running longer with a complete and precise alignment.</p>
+<h3>How can I save on a wheel alignment&#63;</h3>
+<p>Sign your ride up for the Lifetime Alignment service. It&#8217;s in your car&#8217;s best interest. Look, if you plan on keeping your car for many miles to come, you&#8217;re going to need an alignment from time to time.  With all those pot holes and bumps and bounces here and there, it&#8217;s actually pretty easy for your vehicle to lose alignment.</p>
+<p><strong>To save on the expensive cost of having to replace tires or parts sooner</strong>, schedule an Alignment Check with every other oil change or every 6,000 miles.</p>
+<p>Our Lifetime Alignment service is a great investment compared to the Standard Alignment service. You&#8217;ll save in the long run knowing your car is properly aligned with regularly performed alignments for the entire time you own your car. We&#8217;ll align your car at any Firestone Complete Auto Care location in the country. That&#8217;s over 1,600 stores by the way.</p>

+<headline><![CDATA[Alignment Settings&#58; Wheel Camber &#38; Caster]]></headline>
+<content>
+<![CDATA[<h2>Alignment Settings</h2>
+<p>The following settings are dependent on the intended use of your vehicle and manufacturer recommendations.</p>
+<h3>What does Camber mean&#63;</h3>
+<p>Camber plays a major role in your cornering and stability. Now, to give you a demonstration, you&#8217;re going to want to use your feet to best understand camber. Let&#8217;s get started.</p>
+<p>Stand up. No, really, stand up. Now, place all your weight on the outside of both feet. This is what is called &#8220;positive camber.&#8221; Now do the reverse and place all your weight on the inside of your feet. That&#8217;s &#8217;negative camber.&#8217; Positive camber is for stability, while negative camber is common in high performance vehicles that require better cornering.</p>
+<p><strong>Quick fact&#58;</strong> While some positive or negative camber is good, too much of either is bad.</p>
+<h3>How does camber differ for different types of vehicles&#63;</h3>
+<p>All vehicles are different&#58; An obvious fact that makes for an important point. While positive camber is used to improve ride quality and vehicle stability, high performance vehicles may require better cornering performance. Either way, your vehicle manufacturer will have the exact angles for this setting. We&#8217;ll use those angles to properly align the wheel camber.</p>
+<h3>How does suspension affect camber&#63;</h3>
+<p>Part of your suspension has these things called rubber bushings. Yes, this part has a funny name, but its importance is no laughing matter. Bushings can break down over time, allowing excessive movement to occur in the suspension. This additional flexibility leads to poor turning performance and accelerated and uneven tire wear.</p>
+<p>Having alignment issues&#63; <a href="/appointment/">Let&#8217;s get you back on the straight and narrow.</a></p>
+<h3>What does caster do for alignment&#63;</h3>
+<p>It&#8217;s all about straight lines with caster. Take a look at a bicycle. Trust us, this is going to be the best way to understand the caster setting. Caster is the reason your bicycle steers in a straight line even after you take your hands off the handlebar. That&#8217;s because the front spindle on your bicycle has a forward angle &#40;caster&#41; built in.</p>
+<p>Your car&#8217;s caster works in the same way. When your car travels straight down the road with little handling on your part, that&#8217;s due to your caster setting. If you&#8217;re driving down a straight path but start pulling to one side, that&#8217;s a sign your caster is off. We&#8217;ll get you all fixed up and realigned.</p>
+<p><strong>What does caster provide to your alignment&#63;</strong></p>
+<ul>
+    <li><strong>Directional stability&#58;</strong> The ability to stay on a straight course with little or no effort.
+    </li>
+    <li><strong>Returnability</strong> After completing a turn, your steering wheel spins back to the &#8220;straight ahead&#8221; position. You can thank the caster for that.
+    </li>
+</ul>
+<h3>Do caster settings change for different types of vehicles&#63;</h3>
+<p>Without a doubt. The caster angle is determined by your vehicle&#8217;s suspension design and the intended vehicle use. If you have a high speed, high performance ride, your sports car will need more caster to handle better on the straightaway and when coming out of turns. Can we get a vrooom over here&#63;</p>
+<h3>Can you detect a caster problem on your own&#63;</h3>
+<p>Sometimes. The most obvious and easiest sign to detect is if you feel your vehicle pulling to one side. This may mean your alignment needs adjustment. To be sure though, bring it to us and let us take a look.</p>
+<p><strong>Quick Fact&#58;</strong> Negative caster settings were more common when vehicles didn&#8217;t have power steering. That may be before your time, but inquiring minds want to know.</p>
+<h3>What does &#8220;toe in&#8221; or &#8220;toe out&#8221; refer to&#63;</h3>
+<p>Now to fully appreciate and understand this alignment angle, you&#8217;ll want to walk like a penguin. Now point your feet out. That is considered &#8220;toe out.&#8221; Ok, now point them inwards. That&#8217;s &#8220;toe in.&#8221; Pretty simple. Apply these position to your front and rear tires, and you&#8217;re now a toe alignment whiz. Go show off your new knowledge to your friends.</p>
+<strong>Knowing the Importance of &#8220;total toe.&#8221;</strong>
+<p>Total toe is meant to be at zero or close to zero while you&#8217;re cruising. If the total toe is off, severe tire wear can result. You see, proper toe settings make it possible for the least amount of resistance to occur when your tires spin. If the total toe is out of whack, you&#8217;ll experience uneven wear on the outside or inside part of your tires depending on whether your vehicle toe&#45;in or toe&#45;out setting is compromised.</p>
+<p><strong>Did you know&#63;</strong> Toe problems are the leading cause of most tire problems and tire wear. It&#8217;s easy to miss the signs of a toe alignment problem. Having your alignment performed as recommended &#40;approx. every 6,000 miles&#41; will help protect your tire investment in the long run. Less tires replaced, more money in your pocket.</p>

+<![CDATA[
+        <h2>Diagnostic Terms</h2>
+        <h3>What is a thrust angle&#63;</h3>
+<p>Does the tail wag the dog&#63; Thrust, and its respective thrust angle, all relate to the positioning angles for your back tires.</p>
+<p>The thrust angle is the degree in which the back tires try to steer the front of the vehicle and is a major factor in your car&#8217;s ability to keep you cruising along a straight path. The more the thrust angle is off, the more the rear of the car will steer the front.</p>
+<strong>To align a vehicle accurately, it is important to understand the positions of all tires.</strong>
+<p>Whether your vehicle has a completely independent suspension or not doesn&#8217;t matter. It is critical to understand how the rear tires are pointed &#40;thrust angle&#41; to accurately adjust the front tires. It&#8217;s a complicated process, but we&#8217;ll get you pointed in the right direction.</p>
+<h3>How do excessive thrust angles affect my tires and suspension&#63;</h3>
+<p>When the thrust angle is off, it&#8217;s like walking a dog: you want to go one way, the dog wants to go the other. As it applies to your driving, if the back of the vehicle steers one way and the front another, then the vehicle is fighting itself and this causes excessive tire scrub and adds extra stress to steering and suspension components.</p>
+<p><strong>Quick fact&#58;</strong> Accelerated, damaging tire and suspension wear can occur in the scenario described above, so have your vehicle&#8217;s alignment checked, especially if you&#8217;re beyond the recommended 6,000 mile alignment interval.</p>
+<p><a href="/appointment/">Get an Alignment Check</a> and get back on the right path.</p>
+<h3>What is the geometric centerline&#63;</h3>
+<p>The geometric centerline is pretty much the center of the alignment universe. It&#8217;s the equator for your car. If you&#8217;re catching our drift, the geometric centerline is the line that every alignment angle is based off. It&#8217;s physically represented as the center line between the front two and back two tires. If you need a more tangible way to think about the centerline, mentally draw a line down the middle of your car from bumper to bumper.</p>
+<p>The geometric centerline is used&#58;</p>
+<ul>
+    <li>as a reference line for rear individual toe angles</li>
+    <li>as a reference line for thrust angle</li>
+</ul>
+<h3>What is a Steering Angle Sensor &#40;SAS&#41;&#63;</h3>
+<p>The Steering Angle Sensor, sometimes referred to as <abbr title="Steering Angle Sensor">SAS</abbr>, is an electronic monitoring device. Its sole purpose is to measure the position, force and  turning rate of your steering wheel. It then reports those results to the various vehicle systems depending on it.</p>
+<h4>A lot is riding on your SAS</h4>
+<p>Everything from your Electronic Stability Control to your Electric Power Steering is affected by the SAS and how you personally operate your vehicle. It is the job of the SAS to communicate and supply your unique driving habits so that your car steers in harmony with your driving habits.</p>
+<h4>After every alignment, the SAS must be reset</h4>
+<p>In order for your alignment settings to function properly, the SAS must be reset. This is necessary for your computer to correctly process the changes that have occurred and for your computer system to relay the correct information about your steering wheel position to the systems that depend on its information to function properly.</p>
+<h3>What is Steering Axis Inclination &#40;SAI&#41;&#63;</h3>
+<p>The Steering Axis Inclination &#40;<abbr title="Steering Axis Inclination">SAI</abbr>&#41; basically operates like your caster, helping your steering wheel return to the straight-ahead position after making a turn or changing lanes. SAI is not adjustable. So, if your SAI happens to be off, this means part of your suspension is damaged or worn and will need to be replaced in order for the SAI to function as intended.</p>
+<p>Symptoms that spell SAI trouble&#58;</p>
+<ul>
+    <li>Tires turning in or out as you&#8217;re attempting to drive straight ahead.
+    </li>
+    <li>Vehicle lifts slightly when you turn the wheel from the straight ahead position.
+    </li>
+</ul>
+<p>Steering Issues&#63; <a href="/appointment/">We can solve them</a>.</p>
+<h3>What does &#34;ride height&#34; have to do with a wheel alignment&#63;</h3>
+<p>Pretty much everything. You could say it&#8217;s the puppet master of your suspension. Your ride&#8217;s height will determine the positioning of everything controlling your ride.</p>
+<p>Your ride height will have a positive or negative effect on these components or alignment settings&#58;</p>
+<ol>
+    <li>Size and position of suspension and steering parts</li>
+    <li>Component mounting points</li>
+    <li>Range of motion of your steering</li>
+    <li>Static alignment angles</li>
+    <li>Intended use of the vehicle. Off road. High performance. All have different uses, and various specifications.</li>
+</ol>
+<p>Your ride height will need to be precise for your vehicle to be in perfect working order. All these factors are designed to ensure ultimate handling, performance and overall driving experience. All alignment angles will be based off your ride &#40;chassis&#41; height.</p>
+<p><strong>Quick Fact&#58;</strong> Ride height can be affected by lugging too much around in your trunk, or simply by fair wear and tear as your vehicle ages.</p>
+<p><strong>Did you know&#63;</strong> Every vehicle has a specific ride height. If it is below that height, that&#8217;s an indication that parts are worn and may need to be replaced in order for your car to align properly.</p>
+<p>Ready for the perfect alignment&#63; <a href="/appointment/">So are we</a>.</p>]]>

+<content>
+<![CDATA[<h2>Why is an oil change important&#63;</h2>
+<p>Why is regular bathing important&#63; It keeps you clean. Same goes for motor oil&#58; it gets &#8220;worn&#8221; during its lifecycle. Regularly scheduled oil changes will help keep your engine clean and avoid the potentially engine&#45;damaging effects contaminated oil can inflict. If you want to maximize engine performance, and most importantly, engine life, don&#8217;t skimp on your engine&#8217;s most vital lubricant.</p>
+<h2>How does motor oil breakdown&#63;</h2>
+<p>Oil is pretty temperamental. One second it is slick, but then, before you know it, slick mutates into &#8216;ick.&#8217; Let&#8217;s take a look at what&#8217;s going on in that engine of yours while you&#8217;re out cruising around.</p>
+<ul>
+    <li><strong>Motor oil becomes less effective over time.</strong> Constant exposure to heat, moisture and air leads to oil degradation &#40;oxidation&#41;. The end result&#63; Oil thickening, sludge, deposit formation and corrosive wear. Sounds awful, right&#63; Well it is, and all these nasty elements can take a toll on your engine. You don&#8217;t want those troublemakers knocking around your engine parts.</li>
+    <li><strong>Oil additives depleted, oil life finished.</strong> When oil additives are completely exhausted, oil can no longer handle the dirt and metals that are freely floating around, causing the oxidation that creates sludge. Most importantly, old oil can no longer protect your engine against corrosion and wear when it breaks down. Picture your engine oil trying to work its way through hard and sticky sludge that&#8217;s clogged up oil passageways in your engine. Doesn&#8217;t sound very effective, does it&#63; &#40;Not to mention all the havoc these added barriers can inflict on your engine.&#41; Leaving oil in your engine well past the recommended oil change date can result in disastrous conditions and expensive repairs.</li>
+</ul>
+<p>Changing your oil on schedule will remove contaminated oil and replenish your engine with fresh oil. Proper lubrication provides the best protection.</p>
+<h2>How does oil travel through my engine&#63;</h2>
+<p>Very smoothly. Oil is pumped through small engine passageways lubricating all moving parts while acting as a cooling agent to reduce engine heat. Talk about a pretty important job. Your engine&#8217;s survival is counting on it. Sit back and relax. We&#8217;ll show you how it works&#58;</p>
+<h2>What are all the parts involved in making sure the oil pumps through the engine effectively&#63;</h2>
+<ul>
+    <li><strong>The Moving Parts&#58;</strong> Valve train, main and rod bearings, piston rings and cylinder walls all need lubrication in order to prevent metal on metal friction in the engine.</li>
+    <li><strong>The Oil Pan&#58;</strong> This is where your oil chillaxes, waiting to be propelled into action by the oil pump. Once the pump gets the oil moving, the oil travels through tiny oil passage ways, lubricating all the functioning parts and then finally dropping back down to the oil pan. Cycle complete.</li>
+    <li><strong>The Oil Pump&#58;</strong> This part is crucial to engine lubrication. The oil pump is responsible for creating the pressure that pushes your oil throughout your engine parts. Without it, your oil would just sit in the pan. And that&#8217;s not very useful.</li>
+    <li><strong>The Oil Filter&#58;</strong> The oil filter captures any harmful debris, metal or dirt that&#8217;s entered your oil system. The better condition your oil filter is in, the better protected your engine will be. A dirty filter is as useful as a dirty napkin. And the only use for that is in the trash bin.</li>
+</ul>
+<h2>What are the technical differences between synthetic blend, high mileage and full synthetic oil types&#63;</h2>
+<p>Looks like we&#8217;ve got a future motor oil connoisseur on our hands &#8212; here&#8217;s a quick guide to understanding the different oil types&#58;</p>
+<ul>
+    <li><strong>Synthetic blend Kendall engine oils with Liquid Titanium&#174;</strong> are formulated with a mixture of synthetic base stocks and conventional base stocks combining the features and benefits of the synthetic and the cost benefits of the conventional base.</li>
+    <li><strong>High&#45;mileage Kendall engine oils with Liquid Titanium&#174;</strong> typically contain swelling additives to rejuvenate aging engine seals. Over time, these rubber seals dry out, crack and lose their flexibility. The swelling additive helps revitalize your seals so you can minimize physical &#40;external&#41; oil leaks as well as reduce exhaust smoke from internal oil leaks &#40;oil leaking past seals into the combustion chamber&#41;. High&#45;mileage oils may also be formulated with higher levels of antioxidant and&#47;or anti&#45;wear additives to provide better protection for older vehicles.</li>
+    <li><strong>Full&#45;synthetic Kendall engine oils with Liquid Titanium&#174;</strong> are 100% man&#45;made, offering performance benefits you won&#8217;t get from conventional oil&#58; better oxidation resistance at high temperatures for reduced dirt accumulation and longer service life; better low&#45;temperature effectiveness for easier starting and pump&#45;ability in cold weather. </li>
+</ul>
+<h2>What happens if I don&#8217;t get an oil change&#63;</h2>
+<p>Don&#8217;t play with fire, because that&#8217;s exactly what you&#8217;re doing with the life of your car if you wait too long to change your oil. Skipping oil changes, exceeding mileage or going long periods of time before your next oil change can accelerate the wear on the vital parts that keep your car running smoothly, eventually leading to premature engine breakdown.</p>
+<p>Repairing engine damage can be a big hit to your wallet, so don&#8217;t wait to get an oil change. You might regret it.</p>
+<p>Need the condition of your engine inspected&#63; <a href="/maintain/vehicleinspection.jsp">We can help</a>.</p>
+<h2>Can my oil change schedule differ from manufacturer recommendations&#63;</h2>
+<p>Believe it or not, it can &#8212; and often does. Check the manufacturer recommendation found in your owner&#8217;s manual. It typically lists oil change schedules for normal driving conditions and severe conditions. Make sure you pay attention to the listed driving conditions that distinguish the two. Severe conditions, such as hotter climates and frequent short trips, can shorten the life of your oil. If the change oil light appears, come in immediately if not sooner.</p>
+<h2>If my car has an &#8220;Oil Life System&#8221; can I change it less often&#63;</h2>
+<p>You&#8217;re on to something here. Oil Life Systems are a more recent advancement by automobile manufacturers and they&#8217;re designed to constantly monitor your driving conditions and mileage to determine the life expectancy of your oil. It&#8217;s common myth Oil Life System measures your oil condition. Although it measures mileage traveled and outside condition factors such as heat, your owner&#8217;s manual will provide you with a very clear oil change schedule based on your specific vehicle and driving conditions.</p>
+<p><strong>Quick Tip&#58;</strong> Think of regularly scheduled oil changes as cheap insurance against more expensive repairs. Not following manufacturer recommended oil change intervals can lead to sludge build up, resulting in engine damage and very costly repairs. Not fun. Check your owner&#8217;s manual for the recommended oil change interval based on the driving conditions you put your vehicle through.</p>
+<p><a href="/appointment/">Schedule your next oil change</a> with our oil experts.</p>
+<h2>What is the best type of oil for my car&#63;</h2>
+<p>The best type of oil is usually the one listed in your vehicle owner&#8217;s manual. However, if you have a high performance vehicle, do a lot of towing or live in extremely hot or cold climates, your car can benefit greatly from a synthetic blend or full synthetic oil.</p>
+<p><strong>Quick Tip&#58;</strong> Factor in the age of your vehicle when selecting your motor oil. When your car hits 75,000 miles, your engine may require a high mileage oil designed to maintain and preserve your engine for the long haul. All in the name of keeping your baby purring to its fullest potential.</p>
+<p><a href="/auto-services/oil/">Learn about the different types of Kendall Oils we carry</a>.</p>
+<h2>What do different oil grades &#40;SAE 5W&#45;20&#41; mean&#63;</h2>
+<p><strong>Caution&#58;</strong> As always, check with your owner&#8217;s manual and your oil tech before you make any adjustments to the oil grade you use in your engine. Pour in the wrong oil type and very damaging effects can occur.</p>
+<p>Now Let&#8217;s decode life&#8217;s biggest mystery&#58;</p>
+<ul>
+    <li><strong><abbr title="Society of Automotive Engineers">SAE</abbr> &#61; Society of Automotive Engineers.</strong>The SAE designation describes the viscosity grade of oil commonly used for passenger cars, vans, <abbr title="sport utility vehicle">SUV</abbr>&#8217;s, and light&#45;duty trucks, etc.</li>
+    <li><strong>W is for Winter.</strong> And the number before the W lets you know how easily this oil will pump at low temperatures. 0W is for very low temperatures, while higher numbers &#40;10W&#41; are designed for milder winter weather.</li>
+    <li><strong>The last number stands for &#8216;summer.&#8217;</strong> While the first number is associated with the winter temperatures, the last number determines the oil thickness at 100&#176;C. High numbers &#40;50&#41; are thicker than lower numbers &#40;20&#41; at that temperature.</li>
+    <li><strong>Thicker oils form a thicker file for better the high temperature protection.</strong> Heavier viscosity &#40;thicker&#41; oils provide superior protection at high temperatures, during towing and transporting heavy loads &#40;engine generates more heat under these operating conditions&#41;. When oil heats up, it thins out. If you drive under extreme conditions, thicker oil will perform better in your engine as it thins out under extreme temperatures.</li>
+    <li><strong>Thinner oils makes it easier to start your car in the winter.</strong> It&#8217;s the dead of winter; do you know the importance of your &#8216;W&#8217;&#63; Well it plays a big role in whether or not your car will start ease or, potentially, not at all. Lower numbers &#40;0W&#41; will perform the best in cold winter while higher &#40;20W&#41; numbers are designed for milder winter weather. Check with us to make sure you have the right oil for your region.</li>
+</ul>
+<p><strong>Warning&#58;</strong> Never switch oil types based on instincts or guesstimates. Check your owner&#8217;s manual first, but also check with one of our oil experts to determine the ideal oil grade based on your driving conditions and vehicle specifications.</p>
+<p><strong>Quick fact&#58;</strong> Multigrade oils &#40;10W&#45;30&#41; can be used over a wider temperature range than single grade oils.</p>
+<p>Call us and find the motor oil that suits your car best.</p>
+<h2>How does Kendall compare to other brands of motor oil&#63;</h2>
+<p>Kendall&#174; engine oils are designed to excel. They are engineered to meet or exceed industry standards and Original Equipment Manufacturer&#8217;s oil specifications for engine protection.</p>
+<p><strong>They are also enhanced with Liquid Titanium&#174;,</strong> a unique additive designed for greater wear protection and increased fuel economy. Liquid Titanium is only found in Kendall motor oils, available at all of our Firestone Complete Auto Care stores.</p>
+<h2>What is the advantage of Liquid Titanium&#63;</h2>
+<p>Liquid Titanium is advanced engine protection available in Kendall motor oil. Pretty cool, right&#63; With Liquid Titanium, you&#8217;ll have an extra layer of protection flowing through your engine to reduce friction among moving parts. Oil protects your engine by keeping it lubricated as the moving parts rub on one another and heat up. But what about when oil completes its cycle&#63; If it drops back down to your oil pan and doesn&#8217;t leave a residual bond, as Liquid Titanium does, metal on metal friction can occur.</p>
+<p>Liquid Titanium&#58;</p>
+<ul>
+    <li><strong>Superior engine protection under extreme operating conditions.</strong> This exclusive formula provides stronger protection for your hard working engine. By bonding to your engine&#8217;s critical parts Liquid Titanium gives your engine an extra layer of protection so you can reduce metal&#45;on&#45;metal friction under those brutal extreme conditions. With Liquid Titanium, you&#8217;ll now have extra protection to keep your engine running longer.</li>
+    <li><strong>Less Work. More efficiency. Energy conserved.</strong> With reduced friction among moving parts, it takes less work to keep the engine running. The result&#63; Increased fuel efficiency. It makes sense&#58; the less energy lost due to friction, the less fuel is consumed by your engine. With all the oil changes we perform, Liquid Titanium saved motorists almost 20 million gallons of gas, last year alone. Wow. But, another pay&#45;off&#63; Less carbon dioxide exhausted.  You can call Liquid Titanium &#8220;Energy Saving&#8221; and &#8220;Environment Protecting.&#8221;</li>
+</ul>
+<h2>What is a valve train&#63;</h2>
+<p>The valve train controls multiple parts in order to manage the amount of air and fuel that enters the combustion chamber at all times.</p>
+<h2>What are main and rod bearings&#63;</h2>
+<p>Main and rod bearings are half cylinder metal fittings that are lubricated so that the crankshaft, connecting rods and engine block function smoothly and avoid friction.</p>
+<h2>What are piston rings&#63;</h2>
+<p>Piston rings are typically a set of three rings that&#58; provide seals for the combustion chambers, transfer piston heat and manage engine oil consumption.</p>
+<h2>What are cylinder walls&#63;</h2>
+<p>Inside each cylinder are walls in which the pistons travel between. These walls must remain lubricated with oil at all times to ensure the pistons don&#8217;t create friction inside any of your vehicle&#8217;s cylinders.</p>
+<h2>What is a crankshaft&#63;</h2>
+<p>The crankshaft is connected to the pistons, providing precise and accurate piston rotation inside your vehicle&#8217;s cylinders. The crankshaft should always remain lubricated as it rotates inside the main and rod bearings.</p>
+<h2>Why choose Firestone Complete Auto Care vs. &#8216;fast lube&#8217; places&#63;</h2>
+<p>Most &#8220;In&#45;and&#45;out&#8221; oil change shops provide very limited benefits outside of a fast oil change. Firestone Complete Auto Care offers so much more. Consider us your one stop shop for all your maintenance, repair and tires needs.

+<![CDATA[<h2>What is engine sludge&#63;</h2>
+<p>Engine sludge is as nasty as it sounds, with more disgusting nicknames like &#8220;mayonnaise sludge&#8221; &#40;soft consistency&#41; and &#8220;black sludge&#8221; &#40;hard consistency&#41;. Sludge is old and congealed oil resulting from excessive contamination, heat and oil additive breakdown. Sludge typically forms over a long period of time and generally builds up when a vehicle owner skips oil changes or travels many miles past the recommended oil change interval.</p>
+<h2>How does engine damaging sludge form&#63;</h2>
+<p>One day your oil is shiny and slick but, over time, that incredible lubricant can become gunky and provide less effective protection for your engine parts. This is an extreme condition, but what could turn such a vital liquid into a gunky, engine clogging mess, you ask&#63;  Here are a couple scenarios.</p>
+<ul>
+    <li>Delaying your oil change is the main culprit. Over time, motor oil becomes contaminated with engine metals, acids and air humidity, eventually transforming into sludge.  Waiting too long to change your oil will increase the likelihood of sludge infecting all the parts where motor oil travels. So don&#8217;t be a slacker, get it changed&#33;</li>
+    <li>Don&#8217;t stress out your oil. Prolonged stress and under&#45;hood heat can lead to sludge filled consequences for your engine oil. Humidity plays a big role in oil consistency. The more humidity that enters your oil system, the sludgier and harder the oil gets. Relieve some stress by changing your oil regularly before it wears out.</li>
+</ul>
+<p>Sludge is no laughing matter. Allowing it to build up could mean serious trouble for your engine. Follow your vehicle&#8217;s recommended oil change intervals, take into account your driving habits, and save yourself the aggravation engine damaging sludge creates.</p>
+<h2>How do driving conditions affect oil&#63;</h2>
+<p>Oil is kind of a drama queen. It only can withstand so much before it starts to become a hot mess.</p>
+<p>Ask yourself the following questions. If you answer &#8216;yes&#8217; to any of these, call us. Seriously. A yes to any of these questions means you could probably benefit from an oil change more frequently to ensure your engine&#8217;s protected.</p>
+<ul>
+    <li><strong>Do you constantly drive in high temperature conditions&#63;</strong> Excessive heat causes the oil to breakdown resulting in sludge and engine deposits. High temperatures also cause oil to thin out; typically resulting in metal on metal grinding or wear in your engine. Ouch. Trust us, it&#8217;s as bad as it sounds. This problem typically can become even more severe if you tow heavy loads or if you leave your car running idle for extended periods of time. A higher grade oil will greatly benefit your vehicle in this situation. And that&#8217;s why we offer a full range of quality motor oils, honed by the liquid engineers at Kendall motor oils.</li>
+    <li><strong>Do you frequently drive short distances&#63;</strong> Get this&#58; Repeated short distance driving means your oil may not have time to reach optimal operating temperatures. This enables water &#40;condensation&#41; and combustion bi&#45;products, such as smoke, to dilute oil, accelerating the breakdown of your oil and shortening the lifespan of your engine components.</li>
+</ul>
+<p><a href="/auto-services/oil/">Find out more about our oil change services</a> that help protect your engine.</p>
+<h2>How do climate conditions affect oil&#63;</h2>
+<p>It&#8217;s all about the extremes. Very hot or very cold temperatures will cause faster oil breakdown, requiring oil changes sooner. Here&#8217;s why.</p>
+<ul>
+    <li><strong>Surviving frigid temperatures requires thinner oils.</strong> If you live in a very cold climate your oil gets thicker as the temperature drops. The end result&#63; Oil is harder to pump during startup, potentially leading to accelerated engine wear and difficulty starting your vehicle. Remember, thinner oils are ideal during winter. The lower the grade &#40;0W&#41;, the thinner the oil, the easier your car will start during those deep freezes.<br /><strong>Note&#58;</strong> Always make sure you are adding the proper Motor Oil to your vehicle. Check your owner&#8217;s manual or call us to determine the proper oil grade for your vehicle.</li>
+    <li><strong>Thrive during hotter temperatures with heavier oils.</strong> For hotter climates, constant towing or idling, thicker oils are a must. That&#8217;s because hot under&#45;hood temperatures can cause your motor oil to breakdown and thin out. If you don&#8217;t have a thick enough oil running through your system, your oil can become too thin, leaving engine parts exposed to metal&#45;on&#45;metal contact. Trust us, you don&#8217;t want to hear that sound.</li>
+</ul>
+<p>Oil is a fickle friend. Make sure to double check your owner&#8217;s manual and check with your oil technician for the proper oil for your region.</p>
+<h2>How do I check the condition of my oil&#63;</h2>
+<p>Unfortunately, simply looking at the oil or rubbing it between your fingers won&#8217;t tell you everything that is going on inside your engine. Wouldn&#8217;t that be convenient&#63; Some symptoms that may indicate a problem with your oil are&#58; low oil pressure, engine overheating or difficulty starting in cold weather.</p>
+<p>Check it yourself&#58; Visually examining oil on your oil dipstick may help identify excessive oil thickening or water contamination.</p>
+<ul>
+    <li><strong>Step 1&#58;</strong> Park your car on a level surface. Parking on an incline will give you an inaccurate reading of your oil level when you pull the dipstick out.</li>
+    <li><strong>Step 2&#58;</strong> Wait until the engine is cold &#40;oil expands when it is hot&#41;.</li>
+    <li><strong>Step 3&#58;</strong> Is the engine cold&#63; If not, go back to Step 2.</li>
+    <li><strong>Step 4&#58;</strong> Withdraw the dipstick, wipe it with a paper towel or rag, and reinsert it all the way back until it&#8217;s back in place. Now, withdraw the dipstick again, hold it horizontally, and read the oil level on the dipstick &#40;every dipstick has a safe oil level indicator&#41;. </li>
+    <li><strong>Step 5&#58;</strong> How does the oil look&#63; Before you reinsert the dipstick, check the oil consistency. If your dipstick has a white, milky discoloration, this means excessive moisture has entered your motor oil. In this case, set up an oil change as soon as possible.</li>
+    <li><strong>Step 6&#58;</strong> Add oil as necessary by unscrewing the oil filler cap, which is about 3 inches in diameter and located on the very top of the engine and typically labeled &#8216;Engine Oil.&#8217;  </li>
+    <li><strong>Step 7&#58;</strong> Recheck the oil level with your dipstick to make sure you&#8217;ve added enough oil.</li>
+    <li><strong>Step 8&#58;</strong> Screw on Engine Oil cap and make sure it is secured tightly.</li>
+    <li><strong>Step 9&#58;</strong> Get an oil change. If your oil level is low, how long has it been since your last oil change&#63; It may be time to schedule one.</li>
+</ul>
+<p>Have more oil change questions&#63; Ask one of our techs.</p>
+<h2>How does oil affect fuel efficiency&#63;</h2>
+<p>It&#8217;s a matter of thickness. The thicker the oil, the more energy &#40;fuel burned&#41; needed to pump it. More energy usage equals less fuel efficiency. That&#8217;s why newer vehicles are designed to operate on lower viscosity oils. The lighter the oil, the less energy required to pump it.</p>
+<p><strong>Caution&#58;</strong> Always make sure you are using the right oil for your car so your engine doesn&#8217;t have to work harder than it needs to, resulting in sluggish performance.</p>
+<p><strong>Quick Fact&#58;</strong> Added &#8216;friction modifiers&#8217; in our Kendall oil require less energy. Friction modifiers help oil flow through your engine with greater ease, requiring even less energy than traditional oils. Again, less energy to pump oil equals greater fuel efficiency for you.</p>
+<h2>What are some environmental facts regarding oil changes&#63;</h2>
+<p>Some may call it &#8216;black gold,&#8217; but we all know disposing of oil improperly is damaging to the environment. You&#8217;ve seen the effects an oil spill has on wildlife. Now imagine if we disposed of oil the same way. And, believe us, people have, and sadly, still do.</p>
+<p>Here are the wrong ways to dispose of oil&#58;</p>
+<ul>
+    <li>Emptying it in the trash</li>
+    <li>Pouring it down sewers and, consequently, into our water supply</li>
+    <li>Dumping it on the ground</li>
+</ul>
+<h2>What&#8217;s the proper way to dispose of oil&#63;</h2>
+<p>The only proper way to dispose of oil is to take it to a facility that accepts used oil for proper disposal or recycling &#8212; like us. We make it easy. Every time you bring your vehicle in for an oil change, we&#8217;ll make sure your old oil is disposed of properly.</p>
+<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> If you do your own oil change, we&#8217;d be glad to take care of your old oil, too.</p>
+<h2>What does my change oil soon light mean&#63;</h2>
+<p>It could mean a few things. But, in most cases, it means you need an oil change. <abbr title="as soon as possible">ASAP</abbr>. Don&#8217;t ignore the change oil soon light. It&#8217;s time for a fresh oil change.</p>
+<h2>What&#8217;s an oil life system indicator light&#63;</h2>
+<p>Many vehicles are now equipped with high tech ways to constantly monitor your driving conditions and mileage to determine the life expectancy of your oil. When the Oil Life System light appears, your computer system has determined you&#8217;ve reached the life expectancy for your current oil. Don&#8217;t doubt your oil life system indicator. It&#8217;s very reliable, accurate and always looking out for your engine&#8217;s best interests.</p>
+<h2>What happens after you reset the oil light&#63;</h2>
+<p>After an oil change, we reset your oil light. Your car computer can now restart the process of counting the miles traveled since your most recent oil change. Ah, intelligent vehicles, where would the automotive world be without them&#63; Your car computer is extremely accurate, so don&#8217;t second guess or disregard its analysis.</p>
+<p><strong>Quick Tip&#58;</strong> This system is not universal for all vehicle manufacturers. Check your owner&#8217;s manual for an explanation about how the system functions in your vehicle.</p>
+<h2>What are common myths about oil changes&#63;</h2>
+<p>These may surprise you. But, rest assured, these myths are, in fact, myths.</p>
+<ul>
+    <li><strong>Change your oil every 3,000 miles.</strong> The myth to end all myths. There once was a time when this mileage interval was the standard. However, times have changed. Today&#8217;s oils and vehicles are of higher quality and capable of handling longer mileage intervals for most vehicles.</li>
+    <li><strong>Synthetic oils are bad for seals.</strong> Engine seals are the little rubber parts that prevent oil leaks, and there&#8217;s a rumor out there that seal failure is caused by synthetic oils. Though that was a possibility many years ago when synthetics were first formulated, today&#8217;s synthetic oils have advanced greatly in makeup and engine protection. Bottom line&#58; seals do age with time but not because of synthetic oils. So use synthetic all you want. We even have a Kendall GT&#45;1&#174; High Mileage Synthetic Blend Motor Oil that is specially formulated with a seal swell additive to help minimize seal deterioration and oil leaks.</li>
+    <li><strong>Synthetic Oils Leak.</strong> This is a rumor that just won&#8217;t go away. But, rest assured, Synthetic oils don&#8217;t create or cause leaks. Now, to set the record straight, oil leaks can occur with synthetics if there&#8217;s already an opening. That&#8217;s because synthetics contain smaller molecules than conventional oils and can enter smaller crevices. But, take note, all the synthetic is detecting is a pre&#45;existing and evolving leak &#8212; not creating it. In fact, the leak would eventually be exposed by conventional oil as the crack becomes larger.</li>
+</ul>

+<h2>What are some future trends in motor oil&#63;</h2>
+<p>Every driver wants fewer oil changes. Luckily for you, the time between oil changes has increased with the increased sophistication of newer cars. The future is all about increasing engine endurance. That&#8217;s why Kendall Oils is always improving their oils to protect your engine over longer intervals. As engine technology and oil keeps improving, the time that can pass before an oil change will be longer and longer.</p>
+<p>Oil Life Systems are a recent addition by automobile manufacturers. The oil life system constantly monitors your driving conditions and mileage to determine the life expectancy of your oil. Although it measures mileage traveled and outside condition factors such as heat, double check your owner&#8217;s manual as well. It will provide you with a very accurate oil change schedule based on your vehicle and driving conditions.</p>

+<![CDATA[<h2>How much oil does my car need&#63;</h2>
+<p>Enough to keep the tin man lubricated. All joking aside, some automobiles only need three quart capacity while bigger vehicles can need up to 15 quarts &#8212; quite the range. Your auto manufacturers list the oil quantities required for your engine in your owner&#8217;s manual.</p>
+<h2>What is the best day to get an oil change&#63;</h2>
+<p>So, you want to know the industry&#8217;s best kept secret, eh&#63; Well, from our experience, Tuesdays and Wednesdays are usually the best days to stop into Firestone Complete Auto Care. Now that we&#8217;ve said that, we can&#8217;t guarantee those will not become the most popular days as a result. But you asked. And now the cat is out of the bag. See you Tuesday or Wednesday.</p>
+<p>We even have extended evening hours and most stores are open Sundays. <a href="/appointment/">Schedule an oil change</a> for any day of the week.</p>
+<h2>Do I need an appointment to get an oil change&#63;</h2>
+<p>You don&#8217;t need one. But, we know how much you value your time. Scheduling an appointment will give you the benefit of servicing your car on your schedule. While we can change your oil on a whim, we can&#8217;t guarantee you&#8217;ll be serviced on the spot. That will depend on if &#8212; and how many &#8212; customers arrived before you. We can give you a heads up beforehand, just call us. Tuesdays and Wednesdays are generally the best days to stop in without an appointment. Appointment or not, you&#8217;ll receive the impeccable service and the same attention and care we provide each and every vehicle we service.</p>
+<p>Have your oil changed on your schedule by <a href="/appointment/">scheduling yours</a> today.</p>
+<h2>What is included with an oil change purchase&#63;</h2>
+<p>A whole slew of things. We don&#8217;t just perform the basics like a lot of oil change shops. We inspect your vehicle too, so you can avoid future problems.</p>
+<p>All our oil change services include&#58;</p>
+<ul>
+    <li>Installation of up to 5 quarts of Kendall&#174; motor oil</li>
+    <li>Installation of new filter</li>
+    <li>lubricating chassis &#40;if necessary&#41;</li>
+    <li>3&#45;month&#47;3,000&#45;mile warranty</li>
+</ul>
+<p>With service we also offer each customer a courtesy check, a 19 point inspection which includes inspection of&#58;</p>
+<ul>
+    <li>wiper blades</li>
+    <li>head, tail and mini lights</li>
+    <li>air filter</li>
+    <li>fluid levels</li>
+    <li>belts and hoses</li>
+    <li>battery</li>
+    <li>tires</li>
+</ul>
+<p><a href="/appointment/">Schedule an oil change today</a>.</p>
+<h2>Why does Firestone recommend other services when I want just an oil change&#63;</h2>
+<p>We&#8217;ll never recommend anything we wouldn&#8217;t recommend to our mothers. We care about your automobile, and that includes the worn parts that typically go unnoticed and undetected at the in&#45;and&#45;out oil change shop.</p>
+<p>We&#8217;ll offer you a free courtesy 19 point inspection. The inspection is designed to detect obvious signs of wear and tear. It&#8217;s a very simple way to take care of the services you need at the store, instead of requiring you to schedule another appointment. A more comprehensive inspection is available as well.</p>
+<p>We care about your car, but most importantly, we care about you. Small problems can become big problems. We&#8217;ll keep tabs on your manufacturer&#8217;s recommended maintenance, to help keep your vehicle maintained.</p>
+<h2>How are technicians trained to do an oil change at Firestone&#63;</h2>
+<p>We train our technicians to perform oil change services using a combination of our own e&#45;learning and training guides along with on&#45;the&#45;job coaching and mentoring. We also have over 2,200 technicians on staff ASE certified in general maintenance.</p>
+<ul>
+    <li><strong>Know&#45;how and expertise.</strong> Firestone Complete Auto Care technicians are instructed to follow manufacturer and industry approved servicing procedures while following the most stringent safety precautions.</li>
+    <li><strong>Sticklers for detail.</strong> Using the latest technology, Firestone Complete Auto Care electronically provides technicians with individual vehicle specs for exact oil quantity and viscosity for your make and model.</li>
+</ul>
+<h2>What does the oil filter do&#63;</h2>
+<p>Just as a water filter traps tiny particles from entering your drinking water, an oil filter catches dirt and other harmful debris before it can enter your engine. It&#8217;s replaced when we perform an oil change.</p>
+<h2>Does Firestone Complete Auto Care use a quality oil filter&#63;</h2>
+<p>Our oil filters are Champions in name and quality. Champion Labs is our trusted supplier of oil filters. Their oil filters not only meet, but typically exceed original equipment requirements for fit, function and quality construction.</p>
+<p>Champion Labs is the world&#8217;s largest supplier of filters, offering filters for everything from air to fuel to transmission filters. They&#8217;re the go&#45;to&#45;choice for many industries including&#58; heavy&#45;duty trucking, construction equipment and mining industries as well as the marine, farm machinery and industrial engine markets.</p>
+<p>Learn more about Champion Labs oil filters at <a href="http://www.champlabs.com" rel="nofollow" class="external">champlabs.com</a></p>
+<h2>Why does Firestone charge for oil filter disposal&#63;</h2>
+<p>Many states mandate disposal of oil in certain ecological ways. And we&#8217;re a big advocate of protecting the environment by providing an oil filter disposal service everyone can count on.</p>
+<p><strong>Get this&#58;</strong> the disposal fee we charge goes directly to paying the recycling cost to the recycling service we use. This fee covers the cost of labor, handling, storage, space, utilities and more. All in the name of providing you with sweet service and doing our part to protect the environment.</p>
+<h2>What do we do with used oil&#63;</h2>
+<p>They say one man&#8217;s disposed oil is another man&#8217;s treasure. After properly recycling your oil with our vendors, it&#8217;s given a second life as fuels and lubricants.  It even becomes re&#45;refined motor oil in our EcoPower oil, which we use in select stores.</p>
+<p>You see, used oil isn&#8217;t useless oil. It means less oil being pulled out of the ground and a lesser impact on the environment. It just takes the right engineers to refine and reuse the oil components. We accept used oil at no charge. Bring in your used oil during store hours and allow us to dispose of it properly.</p>
+<h2>What is the warranty on a Firestone Complete Auto Care oil change&#63;</h2>
+<p>Oil changes come with a 3 month, 3,000 mile warranty. It&#8217;s also the reason a sticker is placed on your windshield telling you to come back in 3 months or 3,000 miles.</p>
+<p>Now, you can operate past 3,000 miles on your current oil if your car manufacturer states a longer oil change interval. Check your owner&#8217;s manual to learn more about your particular vehicle&#8217;s oil specifications. Many cars today are designed to maintain oil for more miles.</p>
+<h2>How does Firestone protect my car during an oil change&#63;</h2>
+<p>We treat your car like we&#8217;d treat our own, with the utmost attention. From fender covers to floor mats to steering wheel and seat covers, we take pride in delivering stellar service and care while your vehicle is in our hands.</p>
+<h2>Does Firestone offer a 10&#45;minute oil change&#63;</h2>
+<p>The short and honest answer&#58; no. Most oil changes are completed within 30 minutes, but can run longer depending on how busy we are at the moment. Scheduling an oil change appointment is the best way to shorten the wait time.</p>
+<p>Our goal is to keep your car running newer, longer. And that takes a little extra care. Just think of us as your car doctor. You wouldn&#8217;t see a doctor whose goal is to get you out as fast as possible so he can move on to the next in line. Same philosophy applies to your vehicle. Allowing proper time to fully service your vehicle during an oil change is our way of providing you with the best and most complete service.</p>
+<p><strong>Quick Tip&#58;</strong> Request our free courtesy check and we&#8217;ll visually inspect all fluid levels, belts, hoses, tires and air pressure.  While that may take a few extra minutes, we think it will save you a few headaches too, should anything need to be replaced.</p>
+<h2>Does getting an oil change with us void my vehicle&#8217;s warranty coverage&#63;</h2>
+<p>No. Who told you that nonsense&#63;&#33; As long as you&#8217;re using the manufacturer recommended oil grade &#40;i.e. 5W20&#41; and get oil changes on schedule, you&#8217;re good to go.</p>
+<h2>How can I save on an oil change&#63;</h2>
+<p>Here, let us grease your engine towards future savings.</p>
+<p>Save yourself some money by following any one of these tips&#58;</p>
+<ul>
+    <li><strong>Only get an oil change every 3,000 miles, if necessary.</strong> Bet you didn&#8217;t think we&#8217;d say that. Newer vehicles have been engineered to handle longer maintenance intervals.  Check your owner&#8217;s manual for the recommended intervals for your vehicle. However, pay attention, factors such as driving conditions and driving habits can determine how frequently you&#8217;ll need to change your oil.</li>
+    <li><strong>Be a coupon watcher.</strong> We&#8217;re always looking out for your wallet. If you&#8217;re on a tight budget, keep an eye out for <a href="/offers/">our latest oil change deals</a>.</li>
+    <li><strong>Do it yourself.</strong> Do you enjoy the smell of hot burnt oil and the feeling of it dripping down your arms&#63; What about the hassle of disposing of the old oil properly&#63; Talk about time consuming. If those scenarios aren&#8217;t your cup of tea, allow us to get our hands dirty for you. Bring it to us and we&#8217;ll have you ready to go in no time.</li>

+        <h2>Maintenance</h2>
+        <h3>Why is an car maintenance important&#63;</h3>
+<p>The simple answer&#58; to help keep your car running newer, longer. By letting us perform routine maintenance, you&#8217;ll help spare bigger car trouble.</p>
+<p>Lapsing maintenance on your car&#8217;s vital fluid exchanges, dirty filters, fussy belts and old spark plugs can lead to bigger problems like busted&#45;up radiators, slipping gear shifts and engine failure. That&#8217;s why routine maintenance is key to vehicle longevity. Maintenance you think you can &#8220;let go&#8221; in the short term can often be an &#8220;oh, no&#33;&#8221; down the road.</p>
+<p>Your manufacturer has designed a maintenance schedule &#40;found in your owner&#8217;s manual&#41; around the specific makeup of your particular vehicle. Follow this schedule and chances are your vehicle will deliver optimal performance as you rack up the miles, help your parts last longer and save you some dough on more expensive replacement parts.</p>
+<h3>How often should I have routine maintenance performed&#63;</h3>
+<p>Each car, <abbr title="sport utility vehicle">SUV</abbr>, truck or van manufacturer lists time and mileage intervals for routine maintenance, inspections and part replacement. Some service intervals are shorter, requiring more frequent maintenance, while other maintenance intervals are longer, occurring once or twice over the life of your vehicle.</p>
+<p>Some vehicles have internal clocks that alert you to when you need maintenance as well. Heed those indicator lights.</p>
+<p>Of course, if you need work sooner, we&#8217;re here to help between recommended intervals.  <a href="/maintenance/schedule.jsp">Find your vehicle&#8217;s recommended maintenance intervals</a>.</p>

+<h3>Will the expense of car maintenance &#8220;pay off&#8221; in the long run&#63;</h3>
+<p>Regular maintenance for your ride is a wise decision, my friend &#8211; both for the longevity of your car and the length of your dollar. Regular maintenance helps prevent having to replace more expensive parts.</p>
+<p>Let&#8217;s take an oil change for an average sedan over 100,000 miles as an example. During those miles, you&#8217;d change your oil about 25 times &#40;an oil change every 4,000 miles&#41;. Assuming the average cost of the oil change is about &#36;25, you&#8217;ll spend &#36;625 on oil changes overall. If you were to go without an oil change during that period, your engine would likely flood with contaminants and eventually seize. The reason&#63; Thick, dirty oil that can&#8217;t properly lubricate vital parts, leading to <span class="nowrap">metal&#45;on&#45;metal</span> friction. The result&#63; One cost&#45;prohibitive roadblock&#58; an engine replacement that hovers around &#36;4,000.</p>
+<p>You can find all recommended maintenance intervals in your vehicle&#8217;s owner&#8217;s manual. Or, you can locate it all right here on our website.</p>

+        <h2>Bulb Replacement</h2>
+        <h3>How many different bulbs are there in the average vehicle&#63;</h3>
+<p>More than most Christmas trees. For real. And it&#8217;s not just fog lights, turn signals and rear, mirror and side bulbs you&#8217;ll have to contend with. Bulbs are everywhere, especially on vehicles with fancy <abbr title="Light&#45;Emitting Diode">LED</abbr> bulbs&#58; they can feature over 100 bulbs in the rear of the vehicle alone. These bulbs will last varying amounts of time, so inspect your vehicle regularly to make sure no crucial rear or front lights are out.</p>
+<p>Bulb out&#63; Let&#8217;s get your lights shining again. <a href="/appointment/">Schedule an appointment</a>.</p>
+<h3>How long do bulbs typically last&#63;</h3>
+<p>Bulb life varies, so it&#8217;s important to get your vehicle inspected on a regular basis. We can spot burn&#45;outs with our free courtesy check which is available with any service &#8211; even a routine oil change. Ask for a free courtesy check next time you&#8217;re in and we&#8217;ll visually inspect your ride, including all the lights. If a bulb is out or weak, we&#8217;ll let you know &#8211; and bring back the shine.</p>
+<p>Shine on with a new bulb. <a href="/appointment/">Schedule an appointment</a>.</p>
+<h3>How many vehicles on the road today have burned out exterior bulbs&#63;</h3>
+<p>One of every three vehicles has a light that&#8217;s burned out. With so many lights on vehicles these days, it&#8217;s inevitable. It&#8217;s easy to assume that a person not using their turn signal is a reckless driver. However, with a 33&#37; chance that person may have a bulb burned out, they might not even know they have a burnout.</p>
+<p><strong>Stay alert.</strong> If you notice people honking or blinking their lights at you for what seems like no reason at all, don&#8217;t lose your cool. They may be trying to tell you something very important&#58; one of your lights is out. Then again, maybe they&#8217;re just not very nice.</p>
+<p>Bulb out&#63; Come in. <a href="/appointment/">Schedule an appointment</a>.</p>
+<h3>Beyond the obvious benefit of better lighting, are there any other benefits of bulb replacement&#63;</h3>
+<p>Sure, light is a boon if you&#8217;re afraid of the dark. When you&#8217;re talking about headlights, it&#8217;s also integral to increasing visibility &#8211; for you and others &#8211; when traveling down dark stretches of road. Working turn signals and brake lights are of utmost importance, too. They decrease the likelihood of a collision by enabling other drivers to see you and anticipate your intended actions on the road.</p>
+<p>Time for new bulbs&#63; <a href="/appointment/">Locate your Firestone Complete Auto Care</a>.</p>
+<h3>What is the biggest factor that leads to bulb burn&#45;outs&#63;</h3>
+<p>Condensation and moisture buildup are the biggest bulb killers. Let&#8217;s face it, water and electrical devices were never meant to coexist.</p>
+<p>With a free courtesy check, we can look for condensation buildup inside any bulb casings, especially your headlights. Condensation may mean your tail or headlight assembly is damaged and needs replacement.</p>
+<p>Get your bulbs replaced. <a href="/appointment/">Schedule an appointment</a>.</p>
+<h3>Why do you have to replace the entire headlight casing when it&#8217;s just the bulb that has burned out&#63;</h3>
+<p>Some auto manufacturers require a brand new headlight kit to be installed rather than just replacing the bulb. And if part of your headlight casing is damaged or missing, many manufacturers don&#8217;t supply individual replacement parts for headlight housing.</p>
+<p>This is true with popular LED lights. Any lights on a LED fixture will require the entire light assembly to be replaced. While it&#8217;s true this usually costs more than just a bulb replacement, you&#8217;ll have brand new manufacturer equipment, which is always a plus.</p>
+<p>Replacing an entire headlight casing, sometimes, can be the best thing that happened to your headlight. The reason&#63; A broken or missing casing part may lead to future malfunctions and burn&#45;outs.</p>
+<p>Time for new headlights&#63; <a href="/appointment/">Schedule an appointment</a>.</p>
+<h3>How can you tell if a bulb is about to burn out&#63;</h3>
+<p>You can&#8217;t, unless you have burned&#45;out&#45;bulb <abbr title="extrasensory perception">ESP</abbr>. If you have this unique skill, please call us, as we&#8217;d like to employ you. All kidding aside, the only true indication that a bulb is about to burn out is if you notice one or both your headlights appear dimmer than normal.</p>
+<h3>How do I detect a burned out turn signal&#63;</h3>
+<p>A turn signal that blinks faster, or one that is supposed to be on but never blinks, are both indicators. If you notice your turn signal behaving this way, that&#8217;s a warning from your car that one of the turn signal bulbs is burned out. Not all cars have these burn&#45;out indication features though, so make be sure to inspect your vehicle periodically.</p>
+<p><strong>Although exterior bulb burn&#45;outs are hard to detect while you&#8217;re driving</strong>, it&#8217;s important to check your exterior lights on a semi&#45;regular basis. Some people go months or &#8211; gasp &#8211; years without noticing a very important bulb is burned out. Bulb replacement is a must to let other drivers know you&#8217;re there or what your intentions are when moving on the road.</p>
+<p>Ask for a free courtesy check, and we&#8217;ll check all your bulbs for you. <a href="/appointment/">Schedule a free courtesy check</a>.</p>
+<p>Time for new bulbs&#63; <a href="/appointment/">Schedule an appointment</a>.</p>
+<h3>Do you offer headlight condensation service&#63;</h3>
+<p>Yes, we do inherently. This is because condensation and moisture buildup in your headlights can result in burned&#45;out bulbs or reduced output. We get rid of the bulb condensation by changing the bulb and/or casing. What&#8217;s worse is when water collects in headlights because it can damage your car&#8217;s electrical system. With this service, we&#8217;ll make sure condensation is eliminated by replacing the bulb and casing, if necessary.</p>
+<h3>Which bulbs does Firestone Complete Auto Care carry&#63;</h3>

+<h2>Wiper Blade Replacement</h2>
+<h3>How long do wiper blades generally last&#63;</h3>
+<p>Wiper longevity depends on where you live. Heat really wears on those rubber windshield squeegees; therefore, if you live in a hot climate, wipers will inevitably require more frequent replacement. Accordingly, if you use your wipers often &#8211; and live in a rainy, snowy or icy neck of the country &#8211; expect a shortened blade life.</p>
+<p><strong>A general wiper blade rule of thumb&#58;</strong> if wipers smear water or snow and obstruct your view when they swoosh by, it&#8217;s time for new blades.</p>
+<p>Worn blades&#63; <a href="/appointment/">Get them replaced at your nearest Firestone Complete Auto Care</a>.</p>
+<h3>Why don&#8217;t wiper blades last longer&#63;</h3>
+<p>Wiper blades may be one of the most misunderstood parts in automotive history. After all, they&#8217;re the only true functioning component that is completely exposed to the nasty outside elements, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days of the year. Talk about a tough life. And a tough job keeping visibility clear &#8211; whatever the weather.</p>
+<p>Given these factors, it&#8217;s no wonder something so small, thin and crucial can only provide optimal visibility for so long.</p>
+<p>Retire your old blades. And get new Bosch wiper blades. <a href="/appointment/">Schedule an appointment</a>.</p>
+<h3>What are the biggest factors that cause wiper blades to wear down&#63;</h3>
+<p>Your wipers are exposed to the outside world day in and day out, which means everything from heat and rain to snow, road salt and ice all have an effect. On top of these factors, blades just wear down over time with repeated use.</p>
+<p>Have fresh, new Bosch wiper blades installed today. <a href="/appointment/">Schedule an appointment</a>.</p>
+<h3>What happens as wiper blades get older&#63;</h3>
+<p>All that sun. All that heat. All that use. All these factors affect the life of your wiper blades. As your rubber wiper blades endure the elements, they start losing their flexibility and become brittle. The rubber cracks and tears. The blades wear down, exposing metal. Eventually, you&#8217;re left with blades that streak and smudge, making it more difficult to see all that&#8217;s ahead of you. Worst of all, if the rubber runs out on the blade, the metal underneath can scratch your windshield. Yikes.</p>
+<p>Renew your ride with new Bosch wiper blades. <a href="/appointment/">Schedule an appointment</a>.</p>
+<h3>Will I be able to tell a difference when I have my wiper blades replaced&#63;</h3>
+<p>Replacing your blades can be like taking a blindfold off of your eyes. Better functionality will lead to better visibility. Our selection of Bosch wiper blades come highly regarded by the automotive industry, thanks to advanced design and superior quality. New Bosh wiper blades deliver stellar visibility.</p>
+<p>Have fresh, new Bosch wiper blades installed today. <a href="/appointment/">Schedule an appointment</a>.</p>
+<h3>What are some symptoms that you need new wiper blades&#63;</h3>
+<p>Smearing, smudging, streaking, rubbing, scraping on your windshield. If your swooshes don&#8217;t sound right, look right, or, most importantly, if you can&#8217;t see well when your blades go back and forth, it&#8217;s time for a wiper replacement.</p>

+        <h2>Coolant Fluid Exchange</h2>
+        <h3>What is the job of coolant fluid&#63;</h3>
+<p>It&#8217;s the working fluid for the cooling system, which controls the operational condition of the engine. Because the engine is a controlled explosion, it needs to be kept between a specific temperature range for optimal performance. Whether it&#8217;s cold or hot outside, the cooling fluid allows the cooling system &#40;including the radiator&#41; to keep the engine and radiator at just the right temperature. Think of this way&#58; coolant fluid is a warm blanket in the winter and a misting fan in the summer.</p>
+<h3>How does coolant fluid flow through the system&#63;</h3>
+<p>A car&#8217;s coolant system operates on a loop, pumping a mix of water and antifreeze to your radiator to regulate engine temperature. Because coolant absorbs the heat generated by the engine and transports it to the radiator to cool down, it stands to reason that low or weak coolant levels mean its job performance is compromised and your car can overheat.</p>
+<h3>Why is a coolant fluid exchange so important&#63;</h3>
+<p>Coolant breaks down like any other engine fluid. Just as motor oil has vital engine performance additives, your coolant has additives that prevent boiling, freezing and corrosion. When these additives are depleted, contaminants and debris can begin to build up on your radiator, affecting its performance. It&#8217;s essential to have your coolant fluid exchanged every so often. And by the way, coolant spelled backward is tnalooc &#8211; a word that makes absolutely no sense.</p>
+<h3>How often should a coolant exchange be performed on my vehicle&#63;</h3>
+<p>Surprise, surprise&#58; vehicles don&#8217;t need new coolant over the same time periods. Some vehicles have long&#45;life fluids pre&#45;installed on the assembly line and don&#8217;t require servicing as often. So, go ahead and jump up and down if you&#8217;re one of the lucky ones with longer life fluids. You win.</p>
+<p>For all the <strong>non&#45;long&#45;life fluid vehicle owners</strong> out there, you may require a coolant exchange as frequently as every 15,000 miles. You can find coolant information &#8211; and learn when it needs to be replaced &#8211; in your vehicle&#8217;s owner&#8217;s manual.</p>
+<h3>What is the benefit of having a coolant fluid exchange performed&#63;</h3>
+<p>Pun intended&#58; it all boils down to your vehicle operating at an ideal temperature. Old coolant can cause overheating. No coolant or low coolant levels can lead to ugly things, such as blown gaskets, warped cylinder heads and damage to your water pump and radiator. If the temperature gauge creeps upward, don&#8217;t ignore the warnings &#8211; have your coolant checked out before your system reaches its boiling point.</p>
+<p>For coolant exchange or replacement, <a href="/appointment/">schedule an appointment today</a>.</p>
+<h3>How does coolant&#47;antifreeze break down&#63;</h3>
+<p>Time and miles &#8211; it&#8217;s a simple equation. When they&#8217;re at the top of their game, the additives in coolant&#47;antifreeze provide protection, inhibiting corrosion &#40;rust&#41; and scale formation in your car&#8217;s radiator and engine. Over time, these additives get depleted, and the solution becomes less alkaline, leaving your car vulnerable to costly repairs and even engine failure.</p>
+<p>Conventional coolant&#47;antifreeze has the shortest life, but it&#8217;s important to remember not all vehicles are compatible with &#8220;long life&#8221; or &#8220;extended life&#8221; antifreezes. All coolants, through normal operation, eventually become dirtied and contaminated with debris from your engine&#8217;s cooling system. When this happens, the coolant fails to reduce higher temps during hot weather and increase temps during freezing weather. It can also lead to a rust&#45;clogged radiator and heater. What&#8217;s more&#58; the inability to regulate temperature in your engine badly affects other car parts, such as head gaskets, cylinder blocks and o&#45;rings.</p>
+<p><strong>Quick Fact&#58;</strong> Both the American Automobile Association and U.S. Department of Transportation note the majority of roadside breakdowns can be attributed to cooling system failures.</p>
+<p><a href="/appointment/">Schedule a coolant exchange. Right now.</a></p>
+<h3>Can bad things happen if my ride has low or weak coolant&#63;</h3>
+<p>If your engine overheats due to inefficient coolant, dangerous conditions can ensue. Your engine can seize up, crack and stop while your car is in motion. The same holds true during colder weather, when your engine is subject to freeze damage. Scary stuff. This is not an area you want to neglect.</p>
+<h3>What might indicate that my engine&#8217;s coolant needs exchanging or inspection&#63;</h3>
+<p>Significant coolant problem indicators&#58;</p>
+<ul>
+    <li><strong>Low coolant levels&#58;</strong> If your coolant is low, you could have a leak in your cooling system. You may be able to see the leak under your vehicle, and you may be able to smell it as well. If you notice this, get your coolant inspected at the soonest opportunity. Other potential leak culprits include a bad radiator cap, blocked radiator or damaged sensor.</li>
+    <li><strong>Discolored coolant&#58;</strong> Coolant color should never change, but it can when coolant gets contaminated with debris or it&#8217;s been in your car so long that the additives in it deplete. When coolant color changes or gets cloudy, bring it to us to see if it needs to be changed.</li>
+    <li><strong>Engine overheats&#58;</strong> Worst&#45;case scenario&#58; your engine can overheat, seize&#45;up and crack, causing your car to stop completely. If this has happened, it&#8217;s probably too late for a fluid exchange &#8212; you may need a whole engine exchange.</li>
+</ul>
+<p>It&#8217;s a cool time for a coolant exchange. <a href="/appointment/">Schedule an appointment</a>.</p>
+<h3>Are there different types of coolant, and is one &#8220;better&#8221; than another&#63;</h3>
+<p>There are currently three popular coolant types. But most every coolant on the market today contains the same main active cooling ingredient&#58; ethylene glycol. Water and dye are other common ingredients that are consistent among coolant types. The main differences are in the specially formulated additives.</p>
+<ul>
+    <li><strong>Conventional green coolant&#47;antifreeze.</strong> The most basic coolant also has the shortest life span. These conventional formulas typically have anti&#45;corrosion additives that provide extra corrosion protection. However, these additives deplete over time, requiring coolant to be replaced about every two years, 24,000 miles or as recommended by your manufacturer. Read your owner&#8217;s manual since some manufacturers even set 15,000&#45;mile intervals.</li>
+    <li><strong>Dexcool&trade; coolants provide extended coolant life.</strong> There are a variety of Dexcool&trade; formulas, but they all contain long life organic acid technology &#40;OAT&#41; additives that protect your system from corrosion longer. Dexcool&trade; will also be able to remain in your system over a longer period of time, sometimes for as far as 150,000 miles. See your owner&#8217;s manual for more information regarding the coolant type in your vehicle.</li>
+    <li><strong>Hybrid <abbr title="Organic Acid Technology">OAT</abbr> antifreezes and coolants.</strong> We&#8217;re talking about the newer hybrid coolants not hybrid cars. These hybrid coolants go in regular cars and can give your ride a fast&#45;acting formula that may last for an epoch &#40;up to 150,000 miles&#41;. If your vehicle manufacturer specifies that your vehicle is not OAT compatible, a hybrid OAT may be the solution to this problem. Hybrid OAT coolants and antifreezes were designed to solve this coolant compatibility issue. Before using this coolant type, read the label to verify it meets your manufacturer&#8217;s standard.</li>

+<h3>How can we differ from a &#8220;drain and fill&#8221; coolant service&#63;</h3>
+<p>We offer a &#8220;drain and fill&#8221; solution if that is the service you ask for. While drain and fills can work well, they can also leave a considerable amount of old, dirty fluid in the system. This can rob your coolant system of the vital cleaning that&#8217;s necessary for optimal performance. A more comprehensive coolant system cleaning is the old&#45;to&#45;new coolant fluid exchange, where we flush out the old coolant with our flush machine and then put new coolant in.</p>
+<h2>Transmission Fluid Exchange</h2>
+<h3>What is the best day to get a fluid exchange&#63;</h3>
+<p>So, you want to know the industry&#8217;s best kept secret, eh&#63; Well, from our experience, Tuesdays and Wednesdays are usually the best days to stop into Firestone Complete Auto Care. Now that we&#8217;ve said that, we can&#8217;t guarantee those will not become the most popular days as a result. But you asked. And now the cat is out of the bag. See you Tuesday or Wednesday.</p>
+<p>We even have extended evening hours and most stores are open Sundays. <a href="/appointment/">Schedule an oil change</a> for any day of the week.</p>
+<h3>What is transmission fluid&#63;</h3>
+<p>It&#8217;s your transmission&#8217;s lifeline, enabling your vehicle to seamlessly shift gears without tearing them to shreds. Transmission fluid is a unique, hydraulic&#45;powered liquid that&#8217;s designed to cool and lubricate your transmission&#8217;s internal parts so each gear shift feels silky smooth. This fluid ultimately helps preserve the life of the transmission system. Yeah, it&#8217;s that crucial.</p>
+<h3>Do you service transmission fluid exchanges for both automatic and manual transmission, and what&#8217;s the difference&#63;</h3>
+<p>We perform fluid exchanges for both types of transmissions.</p>
+<p>The main thing you need to know&#58; automatic transmissions usually require more frequent fluid exchanges because their systems generate more friction than manual transmissions. Manual transmissions can go a while longer before a fluid exchange because they have fewer moving parts and aren&#8217;t designed as intricately as automatics. Automatics feature a more complex design.</p>
+<p>Of course, it&#8217;s always wise to check your owner&#8217;s manual for interval information. Or check your make and model interval here, on our <a href="/maintenance/schedule.jsp">scheduled maintenance page</a>.</p>
+<p><strong>Quick Tip&#58;</strong> Many manual transmissions use the same fluid as automatics, while other use gear oil. See us or refer to your owner&#8217;s manual to learn about which fluid is right for your ride.</p>
+<h3>How are manual and automatic transmissions built differently&#63;</h3>
+<p>Each transmission is built differently and requires different maintenance intervals, generally speaking.</p>
+<p>Automatic and manual transmissions differ in terms of how they transfer power from the engine&#58; manual transmissions use a clutch, while automatic transmissions employ a torque converter, a device that uses oil flow to transfer power. Manual transmissions involve the meshing and un&#45;meshing of gears with each manual gear shift, while automatic transmissions are a controlled changing of gears that happens automatically without a human operator.</p>
+<p>Generally speaking, automatic transmission fluid needs to be replaced more frequently than manual transmission fluid. This is because the system is more intricate and depends more on fluid to help change gears automatically.</p>
+<h3>Why is a transmission fluid exchange so important&#63;</h3>
+<p>Your system requires a transmission fluid exchange to avoid the damaging effects old fluid can have on your transmission.</p>
+<p>Transmission fluid contains important additives, and those additives wear out over time. The additives provide the transmission and its gears with proper lubrication, keeping harmful debris out, while ensuring the system stays cool. Once the additives deplete, debris is free to float around and wreak havoc. <strong>Debris, compromises lubrication and cooling, and that has the potential to destroy your transmission</strong>.</p>
+<p>Don&#8217;t delay a transmission fluid exchange &#8211; especially if you don&#8217;t remember the last time you had one.</p>
+<p>Protect your gears. <a href="/appointment/">Schedule a transmission fluid exchange today</a>.</p>
+<h3>How often should I have a transmission fluid exchange&#63;</h3>
+<p>The good news is you don&#8217;t have to change transmission fluid as often as motor oil. Change intervals vary by make and model and whether you have automatic or manual transmission. It&#8217;s generally recommended you get your transmission fluid exchanged every 24,000 to 36,000 miles or every two&#45;to&#45;three years &#8211; whichever comes first. It&#8217;s important to note, though, that some new car manufacturers recommend exchanging transmission fluid every 15,000 or even 100,000 miles. Some systems even feature sealed systems, which require no transmission exchange at all.</p>
+<p>At Firestone Complete Auto Care, we follow your vehicle manufacturers&#8217; recommended service intervals when performing a transmission fluid exchange service. You can find the recommended maintenance intervals for fluid replacement in your owner&#8217;s manual or right here on our website.</p>
+<p><a href="/maintenance/schedule.jsp">Discover your vehicle&#8217;s recommended maintenance intervals</a>.</p>
+<h3>What is the benefit of having a transmission fluid exchange performed&#63;</h3>
+<p>An exchange prevents your transmission from slipping due to wear and tear &#8211; and it helps prevent your vehicle from not moving at all.</p>
+<p>By having your old transmission fluid exchanged with new fluid, you&#8217;ll be back to driving with a clean, smooth&#45;shifting and replenished transmission system. You may experience what feels like a night&#45;and&#45;day change, since replenishing your system with friction&#45;modifying additives means gears shift more smoothly.</p>
+<p>Discover the power a transmission fluid exchange can have on your driving experience. <a href="/appointment/">Schedule an appointment today</a>.</p>
+<h3>Should I get a transmission fluid exchange on a car with high miles&#63;</h3>
+<p>There are two schools of thought regarding a transmission fluid exchange on a high&#45;mileage vehicle. Some experts believe that it is not a good idea to exchange transmission fluid when a vehicle&#8217;s transmission is operating properly on a car with high miles. This thinking stems from the idea that the fresh additive package in new fluid removes varnish and deposits that &#8220;hold things together.&#8221; Other experts feel new fluid with fresh additives may be all the transmission needs to return to a properly operational state when the transmission in a high&#45;mileage vehicle is not shifting or operating correctly.</p>
+<p>Given a transmission fluid exchange costs far less than it does to replace or rebuild a car&#8217;s transmission, we believe servicing your transmission at the intervals specified in your owner&#8217;s manual is a prudent investment, one that can prevent significant, costly damage down the line. Exchanging transmission fluid does not cause problems that don&#8217;t already exist.</p>
+<h3>How does transmission fluid break down, and what happens when it does&#63;</h3>
+<p>Just like motor oil, transmission fluid experiences breakdown from normal wear and tear.</p>
+<p>When a car&#8217;s transmission shifts gears, it causes friction. This, in turn, generates heat, and that heat must be carried away by the fluid. The heftier the load on the transmission, the more heat it generates and the hotter the fluid becomes. The hotter the fluid runs, the more quickly it experiences breakdown and the shorter its lifespan. When this happens, the fluid&#8217;s ability to lubricate vital parts is diminished.</p>
+<p>Adding insult to injury, heat generated from the transmission&#8217;s mechanics causes debris from the gears, bearings and friction plates inside the transmission to compromise the quality of the fluid.</p>
+<p>Transmission fluid contains additives to produce oxidation stability, reduce foaming and inhibit corrosion; these, too, can take a turn for the worse over time.</p>
+<p>Changing the fluid at regular intervals is the only way to remove the impurities, boost the benefits of additives and keep your car running smoothly. Properly maintained transmission fluid cools and lubricates the moving parts, enabling hydraulics and gears to transfer power from your engine to your wheels. Now, that&#8217;s an important job.</p>
+<p>Never wait for symptoms of transmission fluid breakdown to progress.</p>
+<p>Protect your gears. <a href="/appointment/">Schedule a transmission fluid exchange today</a>.</p>
+<h3>What symptoms may indicate my transmission fluid is breaking down&#63;</h3>
+<p>Few signs indicate there&#8217;s a problem with your transmission fluid &#8211; until it&#8217;s too late.</p>
+<p><strong>Automatic transmission&#58;</strong> A normally smooth ride may feel sluggish when shifting gears or the time it takes to shift gears may be prolonged. This is usually a sign that your transmission fluid is no longer coating your transmission parts.</p>
+<p><strong>Manual transmission&#58;</strong> &#8220;Clunking,&#8221; &#8220;clashing&#8221; or waiting for your transmission to &#8220;catch&#8221; are red flags. Unfortunately, by then, damage has likely occurred.</p>
+<p>If any of these symptoms crop up, do not ignore them. Have us inspect your ride as soon as possible in order to minimize damage to your vehicle.</p>
+<p><strong>Quick tip&#58;</strong> Please check your owner&#8217;s manual for recommended transmission fluid inspections and for the location of the transmission dipstick. If your transmission has a sealed system, there won&#8217;t be a dipstick &#8211; or a way, for that matter, to inspect fluid on your own. Either way, we can check your transmission fluid levels.</p>
+<p>Need your transmission fluid inspected or exchanged&#63; <a href="/appointment/">Schedule an appointment today</a>.</p>
+<h3>What are the other ways to tell your transmission fluid is old&#63;</h3>
+<p>Your transmission dipstick can also tell the story about your transmission fluid condition.</p>
+<ul>
+    <li><strong>The color&#58;</strong> Automatic transmission fluid should be translucent and/or red in color. Meanwhile, healthy manual transmission fluid may appear red, dark green, blackened or even translucent. If your transmission fluid looks cloudy, or has a dark or brownish tinge, it might be time for a fluid exchange.</li>
+    <li><strong>Burning odor&#58;</strong> If your transmission fluid has a burned smell, it&#8217;s time for new transmission fluid.</li>
+    <li><strong>Low fluid levels&#58;</strong> Though it may help to do a transmission fluid exchange if your transmission fluid dips below a safe level, it&#8217;s really time for a transmission inspection since you shouldn&#8217;t be losing fluid.</li>
+</ul>
+<h3>What are the different types of transmission fluid&#63;</h3>
+<p>There are many types of transmission fluid, and they&#8217;re designed for specific transmissions and vehicle types. Inconvenient as it may be, there isn&#8217;t a one&#45;kind&#45;fits&#45;all transmission fluid for vehicles. Because using the wrong fluid can have damaging effects, take your car to us when you&#8217;re unsure. We stock most major brands of kinds of transmission fluid; if we don&#8217;t have your brand, we&#8217;ll get the fluid your car requires.</p>

+<h2>Fuel System Cleaning</h2>
+<h3>What does a fuel injector do&#63;</h3>
+<p>Talk about important. A fuel injector is crucial to making your engine and car GO. It takes fuel from the fuel pump and breaks it into incredibly small droplets that easily mix with air to allow a more complete internal combustion in the engine. Designed and calibrated for the vehicle it handles, a fuel injector makes sure the fuel can be burned more easily and completely.</p>
+<h3>What causes a fuel system to become &#8220;dirty&#63;&#8221;</h3>
+<p>Fuel injectors can experience reduced flow from accumulated varnish and fuel deposits that form after you turn your car off. Technicians call this &#8220;heat soak.&#8221; What is &#8220;heat soak,&#8221; you ask&#63; Well, when you shut off your ride, some fuel remains by the fuel injector. The heat that&#8217;s still present can burn off the remaining fuel, leaving behind a coat of varnish and fuel deposits. Drive with a compromised fuel injector and you may notice the possible effects before long&#58; sluggish engine performance, an improper air&#45;fuel mix and a marked difference in rough idle and <abbr title="miles per gallon">MPGs</abbr>.</p>
+<p>Separate of that, a car&#8217;s fuel system can also be impacted by gas quality. Because gas tanks are located underground at gas stations, their contents tend to pick up contaminants. These small amounts of debris add up over time, dirtying your fuel system.</p>
+<p><strong>Quick fact&#58;</strong> Keeping your fuel injector clean can maximize the performance of your car and lead to improved acceleration and a reduction in harmful emissions. It also may save you some money at the pump.</p>
+<p>Not sure if your fuel system needs a cleaning&#63; <a href="/appointment/">We&#8217;d be happy to take a look</a>.</p>
+<h3>What&#8217;s the benefit of a fuel system cleaning&#63;</h3>
+<p>Here are a couple potential reasons you might want to get your fuel system cleaned&#58; optimal performance and increased MPGs.</p>
+<p><strong>A fuel system cleaning may be crucial</strong> to remove varnish and deposit build&#45;up in your fuel injector. These build&#45;ups may reduce the proper flow of fuel to your engine, potentially robbing you of MPGs and driving performance. However, it&#8217;s important to note that while some vehicles benefit greatly from this service, others are not as sensitive to the problem. It depends largely on your vehicle&#8217;s system design.</p>
+<p>Ease some pain at the pump. <a href="/appointment/">Get a fuel system cleaning</a>.</p>
+<h3>What are symptoms that show my ride might need a fuel system cleaning&#63;</h3>
+<p>Congratulations. By clicking on this question, you are on the road to better fuel economy and optimal engine performance. In order to detect a dirty fuel system, it&#8217;s important to notice the clear signs that your fuel injector needs a professional, performance&#45;enhancing, cleanse.</p>
+<p><strong>Have your fuel system cleaned if you notice these symptoms&#58;</strong></p>
+<p><strong>A sputtering, sluggish engine.</strong> When you&#8217;re driving along, and you start to accelerate from one gear to the next, you may feel your car accelerating in an atypical or sporadic fashion. This could mean your fuel injector flow is reduced. It also may mean you&#8217;re burning more gas and paying more at the pump.</p>
+<p><strong>More frequent trips to the gas station.</strong> Just because you&#8217;ve had your car for a while doesn&#8217;t mean you should be filling up more often. A vehicle&#8217;s age may lead to a decrease in fuel efficiency and can be attributed to a dirty fuel system. If the fuel injector gets dirty, it can&#8217;t break the fuel down into the incredibly small droplets that allow complete combustion. This can make your engine burn more fuel and less power than it should.</p>
+<p>Worst case scenario, dirt can prevent the injector from closing when it needs to, causing fuel leakage and drop in fuel economy and power.</p>
+<p>Get your ride performing like new again with a fuel system cleaning. <a href="/appointment/">Schedule an appointment</a>.</p>
+<h3>How often should I have a fuel system cleaning performed on my vehicle&#63;</h3>
+<p>We suggest cleaning your car&#8217;s fuel system annually to prevent performance&#45;robbing symptoms. Or, if your vehicle manufacturer recommends a specific cleaning interval in your owner&#8217;s manual, use that as the benchmark.</p>
+<p>Clean your fuel system and get more miles from your tank of gas. <a href="/appointment/">Schedule an appointment</a>.</p>
+<h3>What is included in a fuel system cleaning service&#63;</h3>
+<p>We utilize a <strong>three&#45;step procedure</strong> designed to maintain the entire fuel intake system and maximize your vehicle&#8217;s economy and operating performance.</p>
+<p><strong>During our fuel system cleaning service, we&#58;</strong></p>
+<ol>
+    <li>Add a premium, high tech formula fuel system cleaner to the fuel tank, designed to clean the fuel system from the gas tank to the exhaust. This concentrated formula is used to dissolve gum, varnish and carbon deposits. Highly effective detergents and additives clean the fuel injectors or carburetor, intake valves and combustion chambers, while removing water from the fuel system. We also lubricate injectors, valves, upper cylinders and rings.</li>
+    <li>Manually clean the throttle body and throttle plate using a specially formulated, triple&#45;action cleaner for effective removal of varnish, carbon, dirt and other contaminants. This lubricates the throttle plate and all moving parts and provides double protection with a corrosion inhibitor and lubricity agent. This works in conjunction with lubricating oil to prevent scoring and deposit build.</li>
+    <li>Feed in a two&#45;stage intake deposit cleaner through the engine. This dissolves gum and varnish deposits from the intake manifold and runners, valves and combustion chambers. Residual cleaner continues to soften hard carbon deposits for more thorough, long lasting cleaning and lubrication. Also helps reduce build&#45;up in the catalytic converter and reduce exhaust emissions.</li>
+    <li>Provide a <strong>12 month&#47;12,000 mile</strong> limited warranty.&#42;</li>

+<![CDATA[<h2>What do spark plugs do&#63;</h2>
+<p>Think of spark plugs as the tiniest bolt of lighting. Small but mighty, the spark of electricity that the plug emits across a small gap creates the ignition for the combustion needed to start your car. By putting the engine&#8217;s pistons in motion, your car can power up, stay powered up and produce a smooth burn of the compressed air&#45;fuel mixture. Mind you, spark plugs like it hot&#58; they withstand extreme heat and pressure within your cylinders and are built to burn off deposits from fuel additives or other contaminants.</p>
+<p>What does it mean for you&#63;</p>
+<p>Well, without a spark, your car won&#8217;t start &#8211; or go anywhere. And because spark plug health is directly linked to engine performance, it stands to reason weak or bad spark plugs lead to problems, be it issues with cold&#45;starting or misfires during acceleration. Besides &#8211; without healthy ones &#8211; your ride can&#8217;t sustain maximum power, and your vehicle can see a drop in fuel economy. Now, nobody wants that.</p>
+<h2>What spark plugs do you install&#63;</h2>
+<p>We install a range of high&#45;quality, quick&#45;starting Bosch spark plugs, so you can get where you need to go &#8211; without delay.</p>
+<p><strong>Bosch Platinum Plus spark plugs</strong>&#58; Made with durable, efficient platinum, these plugs maximize MPGs. Adding appeal, they can perform 25&#37; longer than previous Bosch Platinum spark plug.</p>
+<p><strong>Bosch Iridium spark plugs</strong>&#58; The next generation high&#45;performing plugs, these up the ante on durability, ignite faster and last up to four times longer than their distant copper cousins. Better, more reliable power and acceleration as well as enhanced throttle response are things you can take to the bank.</p>
+<p>It&#8217;s no wonder that professional motor sports, like the Indy 500&trade;&#42;, have come to rely on the superior quality and sophisticated manufacturing of Bosch spark plugs, too. In fact, the last 17 Indy 500 winners all crossed the finish line with Bosch spark plugs intact. Now that&#8217;s quite the track record.</p>

+<h2>How often should spark plugs be replaced on my vehicle&#63;</h2>
+<p>Luckily, spark plugs don&#8217;t require replacement very often and can go years and many miles before replacement is a must.</p>
+<p>Most auto manufacturers suggest having new spark plugs installed about every 30,000 miles; however, spark plug longevity depends on the condition and type of spark plug. Copper plugs, for example, have the shortest life, while plugs made of more advanced and durable materials can provide up to four times the life of a copper spark plug.</p>

+<h2>What happens to a spark plug as it ages&#63;</h2>
+<p>By the time spark plugs reach old age, they&#8217;ve spent thousands of miles enduring abuse and withstanding the most extreme temperatures and conditions to stay intact. That&#8217;s where the importance of spark plug material comes into play. The stronger the material, the more durable and long&#45;lasting the spark plug. Naturally, though, every spark plug undergoes wear and tear, materials aside.</p>
+<p>Spark plugs can&#8217;t last forever, and here&#8217;s why&#58;</p>
+<p><strong>Spark plug deposit buildup</strong>&#58; When deposits form on spark plugs from interaction with the air&#45;fuel mixture, it can lead to pre&#45;ignition of the fuel. That means a jerky and unreliable supply of energy for your car.</p>
+<p><strong>Expanding, harder&#45;to&#45;jump gap</strong>&#58; When a spark plug ignites, it has to travel across a gap of space in order provide the right level of combustion at the right moment. As spark plugs age, this gap widens as a result of extreme temperatures, debris and normal wear and tear. If the gap is too far apart, combustion will be erratic or ineffective.</p>
+<p>We have the right Bosch spark plug to provide just the right spark. <a href="/appointment/">Schedule an appointment</a>.</p>
+<h2>What is the benefit of replacing a spark plug&#63;</h2>
+<p>The primary benefit is knowing your car will start without a hitch. Needless to say, that&#8217;s not all that matters. New spark plugs provide a lot of other performance benefits as well.</p>
+<p>New Bosch spark plugs will lead to&#58;</p>
+<ul>
+    <li><strong>Consistent production of optimal combustion.</strong> Fully functioning spark plugs equate a fully functioning combustion system. Get this operating successfully, and a lot of performance issues you&#8217;re experiencing could be a distant memory.</li>
+    <li><strong>Better fuel economy.</strong> The National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence says misfiring spark plugs can <a href="http://www.ase.com/News---Events/Publications/Car-Care-Articles/It-s-Easy-Being--Green-.aspx" rel="external nofollow">reduce fuel efficiency by 30&#37;</a>. New plugs, when replaced at specified intervals, maximize fuel economy and save some dough.</li>
+    <li><strong>Smooth and energetic starts.</strong> The first time you turn the ignition with a new spark plug can be a eye&#45;opening experience. That old spark plug may have been the reason your car was experiencing those jerky starts.</li>
+    <li><strong>Less harmful emissions.</strong> The Environmental Protection Agency states that regular engine tune&#45;ups &#8211; especially in regard to spark plugs &#8211; not only save gas but also reduce <a href="http://www.epa.gov/air/peg/reduce.html" rel="external nofollow">air pollution</a>. That&#8217;s a win&#45;win.</li>
+</ul>
+<p>Bosch spark plugs are engineered to last.</p>

+<h2>How involved is spark plug replacement service&#63;</h2>
+<p>The complexity of a spark plug exchange varies from straightforward to very involved. Your vehicle must be worked on when the parts are cold, and the amount of time it takes to complete the service varies by make and model. In some cases, it may be necessary to disassemble vehicle parts in order to reach your spark plugs. Plan ahead, because a vehicle drop&#45;off is usually required.</p>
+<h2>What symptoms may indicate my vehicle&#8217;s spark plugs need replacing&#63;</h2>
+<p><strong>The signs of worn spark plugs. Hear it. Feel it. Sense it.</strong></p>
+<ul>
+    <li><strong>Rattling, pinging or &#8220;knock&#8221;&#45;like noises.</strong> When spark plugs begin to misfire, you may notice unusual noises from the force of the pistons and combustion not working properly. Pistons travel at high velocities. If the spark plug fires at the wrong time, this could lead to constant rattling, pinging or knocking sounds.</li>
+    <li><strong>Hard vehicle start.</strong> If your car is having trouble starting or just feels disjointed and jerky, your spark plugs may not be working right, and this can lead to misfires and erratic performance.</li>
+    <li><strong>Reduced performance.</strong> When you&#8217;re out cruising, your spark plugs fire when you accelerate and change gears. If the spark that this little plug generates isn&#8217;t functioning at 100 percent, your vehicle performance will be poor, and you&#8217;ll experience a sluggish and fuel&#45;wasting drive.</li>
+    <li><strong>Poor fuel economy.</strong> Lots of things can lead to poor fuel economy, though when it comes to old spark plugs, you&#8217;ll find fuel is wasted since your vehicle fails to receive the proper, heat&#45;generating spark at the right time.</li>
+</ul>
+<p>If you&#8217;ve spotted any of these symptoms, we suggest having your vehicle inspected in order to prevent further problems. Healthy spark plugs are vital to your car&#8217;s ability to start up and remain powered.</p>

+<![CDATA[<h2>How does the A&#47;C system work&#63;</h2>
+<p>We all want the ultimate chill blasting out of our vents; especially when it comes to surviving the hot concrete jungle. When the A&#47;C system kicks in on those hot, sweaty days, that&#8217;s something we all relish. But, believe it or not, there&#8217;s no ice machine inside &#40;but at one time ice was used to cool people&#8217;s rides down&#41;. In fact, the cold air generated by your A&#47;C system is actually hot air with hot gases removed during a multi&#45;step process.</p>
+<p>It really is thermodynamics but we&#8217;re not gonna go there. The Cliff&#8217;s note version is simply about changes in pressure causing changes in temperature. Turn the A&#47;C on and the compressor compresses the system&#8217;s refrigerant &#40;Freon&#41; raising its temperature. It loses heat as it flows through the condenser &#40;that second radiator looking thing in front of the radiator&#41;. It passes through the receiver&#47;dryer where contaminants and moisture are removed, and then on to the expansion valve&#47;accumulator where the refrigerant is slowed down further, causing it to lose pressure and temperature before it gets to the evaporator. The evaporator is like a mini radiator &#40;not to be confused with the heater core &#8212; they are two separate things&#41; inside the dash of your ride that gets cold as it further lowers the refrigerants temperature and, additionally, removes moisture from the air. The ventilation system&#8217;s blower motor blows air over the cold evaporator and pushes cool air into the passenger compartment. Complicated, but aaaaaaaaah is it refreshing&#33;</p>
+<p>Now that you know what being cool is all about, if you have problems being cool, <a href="/appointment/">set up an appointment</a> at Firestone Complete Auto Care for an A&#47;C Performance Check.</p>
+<h2>How often should my A&#47;C be inspected&#63;</h2>
+<p>You tell us. How&#8217;s the air feeling in your ride&#63; Are you refreshed and cooled with full air flow when your A&#47;C is pumping&#63; Well, if you answered &#8220;<q>Yes, I am as cool as a cucumber,</q>&#8221; you can cross A&#47;C inspection off your list.</p>
+<p><strong>For all the &#8220;<q>No</q>&#8221; respondents</strong>&#58; do you fall into the &#8220;<q>my A&#47;C is not cold enough</q>&#8221; or the &#8220;<q>it&#8217;s taking way too long to cool down,</q>&#8221; side of the spectrum&#63; Don&#8217;t sweat, stop in for an A&#47;C Performance Check and we&#8217;ll have you back rolling down those hot summer streets cooler than ever. So chill, your A&#47;C is only an inspection away from cooler days.</p>
+<h2>How often do I need my A&#47;C system &#8220;<q>recharged</q>&#8221;&#63;</h2>
+<p>Only when the cool breeze no longer feels as chilly as you remember. Simple enough. Now, it is true that a well maintained A&#47;C system can go its entire life without needing a recharge. But, that&#8217;s if you&#8217;re extremely lucky.</p>
+<p>If you start noticing your A&#47;C isn&#8217;t reaching those refreshingly cool temperatures, have your system inspected. In this situation, most cars will be low on Freon. And since the A&#47;C is a sealed system, low Freon is a big sign that something is not right. It could be a small leak that needs attention or possibly part of the A&#47;C is failing &#8211; bring it in and we&#8217;ll perform an A&#47;C Performance Check and get to the root of the problem.  We&#8217;ll get you back out there cruising with a nice, cool breeze again.</p>
+<h2>What is refrigerant&#63;</h2>
+<p>Typically referred to by the DuPont trade name Freon, the most common Freons are R&#45;12, R&#45;134A, and soon, HFO&#45;1234yf. Freon is pretty similar to motor oil and radiator coolant in that it is a working fluid designed for a specific system; In this case, your car&#8217;s A&#47;C system.</p>
+<p>Refrigerant is a specially formulated mixture that&#8217;s sole purpose for transforming hot air into cold air. It does this by absorbing and releasing heat, ultimately leaving cool air behind.</p>
+<p>Different devices, such as the home refrigerator, home A&#47;C system or your vehicle may use different types of refrigerants. They may or may not be the same. Now that you know what cools down cars, homes and meat lockers, crank that baby up and marvel as your A&#47;C turns stale hot air into your own personal ice box.</p>
+<h2>What exactly is Freon&#63;</h2>
+<p>Sounds like an automotive A&#47;C history class is in order. Well, welcome, pull up a chair and put on your thinking cap.</p>
+<p><strong>Freon, better known as R&#45;12</strong>, was the primary chlorofluorocarbon &#40;<abbr title="Chlorofluorocarbons">CFC</abbr>&#41; used in car A&#47;C systems up until it was banned in the mid 1990s after the <abbr title="Environmental Protection Agency">EPA</abbr>  discovered that it was depleting our planet&#8217;s ozone Layer. Talk about toxic.</p>
+<p><strong>The auto industry has since switched to the CFC free R&#45;134a</strong>. Since the elimination of CFCs from the auto industry &#8212;and all industries for that matter&#8212;the ozone layer has regained its structure, and the ozone holes caused by CFCs are expected to fully close by about 2050 according to the EPA.</p>
+<p><strong>Did you know&#63;</strong> The CFC ban thankfully also marked the end of the CFC heavy hairspray craze that swept the nation in the 70s and 80s. For many people, this change was a welcomed advancement in American hair culture.</p>
+<h2>What is the Montreal Protocol&#63; &#40;R&#45;12&#41;</h2>
+<p>No, this isn&#8217;t a treaty you learned about in history class. The Montreal Protocol is actually the official title of the banishment of R&#45;12 &#40;Freon&#41; and other CFC &#40;Chlorofluorocarbons&#41; emitting products from further use anywhere on the planet. And for good reason&#8212;CFCs were discovered to be tearing big holes in our ozone layer.</p>
+<p>The Montreal Protocol was first signed into law in 1987. If the entire industrial world follows the environmental standards meant to eliminate the use of ozone depleting gases &#40;in place in the United States since 1996&#41;, the ozone is said to fully recover by 2050.</p>
+<p>The Montreal Protocol is why we now use R&#45;134a instead of the ozone depleting R&#45;12. Starting in 2013, certain U.S. vehicle models will begin transitioning to an even more efficient and safer cooling agent called HFO&#45;1234yf. Talk about a mouthful. HFO&#45;1234yf is said to have almost no environmental impact what&#45;so&#45;ever. And that&#8217;s something we can all look forward to.</p>
+<h2>What&#8217;s the difference between R&#45;134a and R&#45;12&#63;</h2>
+<p>You can say the difference is so big that it has spared the fate of the entire planet. Not to get all deep on your psyche and all, but after it was discovered that R&#45;12 and a whole multitude of products containing Chlorofluorocarbons &#40;CFC&#41; were  destroying the ozone layer, environmental scientists immediately started work on an alternative cooling agents free of ozone depleting CFCs. That formula is R&#45;134a&#58; <strong>the standard and only refrigerant permitted in automotive A&#47;C systems today</strong>.</p>
+<p><strong>R&#45;134a, though safer, is not perfect&#58;</strong></p>
+<p>Beginning in 2013, R&#45;134a is being replaced by a new formula, HFO&#45;1234yf, available on select U.S. car models. HFO&#45;1234yf is the cleanest, safest refrigerant yet. And what&#8217;s even more important is that it has been studied and certified as leaving no impact on the environment what&#45;so&#45;ever. Talk about a great advancement in A&#47;C technology that will help protect our planet for all those driven to cruise the open roads for many years to come.</p>
+<h2>But why replace R&#45;134a&#63;</h2>
+<p>Well, although R&#45;134a was designed with the ozone layer in mind, it&#8217;s still made with chemicals that can harm the environment if they leak out of your A&#47;C system or are disposed of improperly. With that known fact, international environmental scientists knew an even safer A&#47;C refrigerant was out there waiting to be formulated.</p>
+<p><strong>HFO&#45;1234yf is set to become the refrigerant standard&#58; </strong></p>
+<ul>
+    <li>It has been tested and found to leave behind virtually no impact on the environment.</li>
+    <li>If your A&#47;C system should leak, there&#8217;s no longer an environmental freak out.</li>
+</ul>
+<p>It&#8217;s all about the future generations of drivers. Our goal as automotive professionals is to provide the best care for your car while preserving the natural environment of the road your vehicle cruises down for many years to come.</p>
+<h2>How many parts make up a car A&#47;C system&#63;</h2>
+<p>Your A&#47;C system consists of five major parts, all working together to cool you off and all your passengers.</p>
+<p><strong>Most A&#47;C systems are built with&#58;</strong></p>
+<ul>
+    <li>Compressor</li>
+    <li>Condenser</li>
+    <li>Receiver dryer or Accumulator</li>
+    <li>Orifice tube or Expansion valve</li>
+    <li>Evaporator</li>
+</ul>
+<p>Your A&#47;C system also consists of hoses and refrigerant charging ports, but the significant work occurs in the five parts listed above. You can learn more about each part that makes up your A&#47;C system starting with the next question. Cool.</p>
+<h2>What is the A&#47;C compressor&#63;</h2>
+<p>The compressor is the core, primary part of every A&#47;C system. If you want to stay cool, a working compressor is essential. We&#8217;ve seen people try to create cold air with out one. Trust us, it doesn&#8217;t work.</p>
+<p><strong>The compressor&#58;</strong></p>
+<ul>
+    <li>Pressurizes the refrigerant that cools your air.</li>
+    <li>Senses temperature changes&#58; Compressors monitor and control temperature output with an electrically operated clutch. This clutch turns on and off whenever you change the temperature, choose a different airflow setting or just when plain old air from outside drops or rises in temperature.</li>
+    <li>Powered by the serpentine belt&#58; That winding belt under your hood is responsible for powering many crucial components, including your A&#47;C compressor.</li>
+</ul>
+<p><strong>Signs of a worn compressor&#58;</strong> Oil or Freon leaks, noise, and erratic or no operation are indications that a compressor may need to be replaced. We can inspect your car for leaks using special refrigerant detecting dyes and devices. You may not be able to see a leak, but our equipment, sometimes referred to as a &#8220;<q>sniffer,</q>&#8221; can detect&#8212;or sniff&#45;out&#8212;a chemical leak even if no liquid is visible. Yea, you can say we&#8217;re pretty advanced over here.</p>
+<h2>What is an A&#47;C condenser&#63;</h2>
+<p>Consider it the master of turning hot refrigerant gasses into liquid. The condenser is mounted at the front of most vehicles, usually in front of the radiator. Air passes through the condenser, turning the hot refrigerant gas into a condensed, cooler refrigerant liquid.</p>
+<p><strong>An A&#47;C condenser is&#58;</strong></p>
+<ul>
+    <li>Found In front of the radiator and often referred to as a mini&#45;radiator</li>
+    <li>The master refrigerant cooler. And still champion. The Condenser radiates the hot refrigerant gasses that have entered from the compressor, reducing its temperature and pressure, turning it into a liquid that moves on to the A&#47;C Dryer.</li>
+</ul>
+<p><strong>Signs of a worn condenser&#58;</strong></p>
+<ul>
+    <li>Leaks</li>
+    <li>Clogged, corroded or damaged fins or tubes</li>
+    <li>Poor air conditioning performance</li>
+</ul>
+<h2>What&#8217;s a receiver&#47;dryer&#63;</h2>
+<p>The receiver or dryer is found on vehicles with a thermal expansion valve. It&#8217;s the safety net responsible for trapping all harmful debris, moisture and liquids from reaching the compressor and other vital A&#47;C parts.</p>
+<p><strong>The roles of the receiver&#47;dryer&#58;</strong> </p>
+<ol type="1">
+    <li>Separates gas from liquid. If liquid isn&#8217;t contained in the dryer, it can enter and destroy your compressor &#40;Compressors aren&#8217;t designed to handle liquids. Only gas&#41;.</li>
+    <li>Removes moisture. To trap moisture, a desiccant is used. Desiccant is similar to those moisture killing packets you find in the packaging of new electronic devices.</li>
+    <li>Filters out contaminants. No one wants a contaminated A&#47;C system. Contaminants can lead to accelerated parts wear and damaging corrosion.</li>
+</ol>
+<p><strong>Quick fact&#58;</strong> If there&#8217;s any moisture present in your compressor, it can mix with the Refrigerant and create very damaging corrosive acids.</p>
+<p><strong>Symptoms of a worn receiver&#47;dryer&#58;</strong></p>
+<ul>
+    <li>Poor air conditioner performance</li>
+    <li>Moisture on glass and&#47;or inability of defroster to remove moisture from glass and windows</li>
+</ul>
+<p><strong>The receiver&#47;dryer must be replaced in the following situations&#58;</strong></p>
+<ul>
+    <li>Anytime the A&#47;C system is opened for repair, the reciever/dryer will need to be replaced.</li>
+    <li>Whenever a technician has determined moisture or debris has permanently damaged your receiver&#47;dryer performance.</li>
+</ul>
+<h2>What is an accumulator&#63;</h2>
+<p>An accumulator is similar to a receiver&#45;dryer but only found on vehicles with an orifice tube. If you have an accumulator, that means you don&#8217;t have a thermal expansion valve.</p>
+<p><strong>The accumulator&#58;</strong></p>
+<ul>
+    <li><strong>Monitors and controls</strong> the amount of refrigerant that enters the evaporator.</li>
+    <li><strong>Stores excess Refrigerant</strong> so that it cannot enter and damage the compressor.</li>
+    <li><strong>Filters debris and removes</strong> moisture from the A&#47;C System.</li>
+</ul>
+<p><strong>When to replace the accumulator&#58;</strong></p>
+<ul>
+    <li>Anytime the A&#47;C system is opened for repair, the accumulator will need to be replaced.</li>
+    <li>Whenever a technician has determined moisture or debris has permanently damaged your accumulator&#8217;s performance.</li>
+</ul>
+<h2>What is a thermal expansion valve&#47;orifice tube&#63;</h2>
+<p>The orifice tube or thermal expansion valve is located between the condenser and the evaporator. Its job is to constantly monitor the pressure and temperature of you&#8217;re A&#47;C system in order to determine the exact amount of refrigerant that can safely enter your evaporator. An orifice tube may also contain a fine mesh screen to block contaminants from the rest of the system.</p>
+<p><strong>Quick fact&#58;</strong> If too much or too little refrigerant enters the evaporator, you could have a big problem on your hands. The proper function of the thermal expansion valve or orifice tube is crucial for successful  A&#47;C system operation.</p>
+<p><strong>Signs of a worn orifice tube or thermal expansion valve&#58;</strong></p>
+<ul>
+    <li>Poor A&#47;C system performance</li>
+    <li>When a technician has determined it has become dirty or clogged</li>
+</ul>
+<h2>What is an evaporator&#63;</h2>
+<p>The evaporator is responsible for cooling air and removing moisture. If cold, refreshing air is hitting your face, your evaporator is working like a champ.</p>
+<p><strong>The evaporator&#58;</strong></p>
+<ul>
+    <li><strong>Located right behind your dash.</strong> The evaporator is the last and most important stop before cold air can hit your face.</li>
+    <li><strong>Cools air with refrigerant.</strong> Low pressure Refrigerant traveling through the evaporator absorbs heat from the passenger compartment dropping the temperature of the evaporator. Air blown over the cool surface of the evaporator then comes out the vents providing the chill you expect.</li>
+    <li><strong>Commences cold air flow.</strong> The best and final stage. Cold air should now be blowing out your vents thanks to the hard work of the evaporator.</li>
+</ul>
+<p><strong>Symptoms of a worn evaporator&#58;</strong></p>
+<ul>
+    <li>Poor A&#47;C system performance</li>
+</ul>
+<h2>What is a compressor clutch&#63;</h2>
+<p>Before the compressor turns on, a special electro&#45;magnetic clutch, conveniently called the &#8220;<q>compressor clutch,</q>&#8221; is necessary to engage and disengage the compressor cycle. The compressor clutch tells the compressor when to turn on or off so that the Freon &#40;refrigerant&#41; is correctly pressurized for use by the condenser which is then delivered to the evaporator where the chill begins.</p>
+<p>Experiencing A&#47;C problems&#63; <a href="/appointment/">Schedule an A&#47;C Performance Check today</a>.</p>
+<h2>What is the clutch cycling switch&#63;</h2>
+<p>The clutch cycling switch senses and controls the temperature in the evaporator core to prevent it from freezing. Although most cars can blow air at temperatures as low as 60 degrees, the temperatures inside the evaporator core can get cold enough to completely freeze the entire core. Not good&#33; The clutch cycle&#8217;s job is to make sure the evaporator temperature doesn&#8217;t reach the point of glacier temperatures.</p>
+<p><strong>Symptoms of a failing clutch cycling switch&#58;</strong></p>
+<ul>
+    <li>Evaporator freezing up</li>
+    <li>Evaporator does not get cold enough</li>
+</ul>
+<h2>What is a refrigerant charge port&#63;</h2>
+<p>This is where the magic happens. The refrigerant charge port is the connection point where new refrigerant can enter the system during an A&#47;C system recharge. Your port is usually located on the bigger A&#47;C hose near or on the accumulator.</p>
+<p><strong>Caution&#58;</strong> Only properly equipped and qualified persons should perform A&#47;C recharging services.</p>]]>

+<p>If you&#8217;re about to go to bed and want to avoid nightmares, you might want to put off reading this until morning. If you&#8217;re about to get in the car, please read on.</p>
+<p>While Black Death is not the same as the deadly plague during the 14th century, a car <abbr title="air conditioning">A&#47;C</abbr> system experiencing Black Death will be infected like the plague. Black Death starts out inside the compressor after refrigerant breaks down. Since refrigerant acts as a working fluid much like how motor oil is the fluid which provides lubrication to protect the engine, a refrigerant breakdown will result in ugly wear, starting in the compressor. From there, the sharp and grimy metal particles created during compressor breakdown can then travel through the rest of your A&#47;C system, wreaking havoc on the entire system. Before you know it, all cold air, and airflow for that matter, will be long gone. Cue the A&#47;C grim reaper.</p>
+<p>The best protection from Black Death is an A&#47;C Performance Check. <a href="/appointment/">Schedule one today.</a></p>
+<h2>Why does my A&#47;C have weak airflow&#63;</h2>
+<p>We feel your pain and discomfort caused by weak airflow. The sweat alone is enough to drive any of us crazy. However, there are a lot of factors at play. If you notice reduced airflow early on &#8211;rather than later&#8211; take the right step and have it looked at before other fatal A&#47;C system damage can occur.</p>
+<h3>Main causes of weak airflow:</h3>
+<ul>
+ <li>Mold or mildew may have accumulated in the evaporator core from residual moisture that occurs during the cooling process. When this happens, air will have trouble reaching your air vents.</li>
+ <li>A hose has come loose. This usually happens with the blower hose that supplies air to the blower unit.</li>
+ <li>Ventilation fan is fried. If the fan&#8217;s not blowing, air won&#8217;t be flowing very well.</li>
+ <li>Seals. No, not those seals down by the pier. Core case seals, blower house seals or evaporator core case seals; All can open up and diminish air flow. A&#47;C ventilation systems are very sensitive and must remain sealed. Once they&#8217;re opened, the whole system is compromised.</li>
+</ul>
+<p>Whatever&#8217;s the cause of your airflow problems, we have the answer. <a href="/appointment/">Schedule an A&#47;C Performance Check</a>.</p>
+<h2>Are there any system warning lights to alert me to an A&#47;C problem&#63;</h2>
+<p>Typically, no, but some vehicles have Driver Information Centers &#40;<abbr title="Driver Information Centers">DIC</abbr>&#41; that may display the status of many vehicle systems. Refer to your Owner&#8217;s Manual for more information.</p>
+<h2>My A&#47;C isn&#8217;t as cold as it used to be, what&#8217;s going on&#63;</h2>
+<p>There are several reasons an A&#47;C system can lose its cool. Bring your ride to us as soon as you start noticing this symptom, it could mean the difference between needing a small repair, or worse, a large one. Here&#8217;s what can cause your cold air to lose its cool.</p>
+<h3>The lack of precious cold air could be caused by:</h3>
+<ul>
+ <li>A Freon leak caused by a failed o&#45;ring, seal, hose or component</li>
+ <li>A clogged expansion tube or refrigerant charging hose</li>
+ <li>Failed compressor or compressor clutch</li>
+ <li>Failed blower motor or blower motor resistor</li>
+ <li>Damaged or failed condenser or evaporator</li>
+ <li>Vacuum leaks</li>
+ <li>Failed switch, fuse, relay, control module, blend door or solenoid</li>
+</ul>
+<p>
+ Leaks can be devastating. When an A&#47;C system develops a leak, you have what&#8217;s called an &#8220;open system.&#8221; If you or your technician discovers the leak early, your repair will be less expensive. Unfortunately, if a leak has been affecting your cold air for a while, moisture will most likely have entered your A&#47;C system and may have damaged other vital and expensive parts. Stay cool. <a href="/appointment/">Schedule an A&#47;C Performance Check</a>.

+<h2>The A&#47;C starts out cool then starts getting warm, what&#8217;s happening&#63;</h2>
+<p>Well, like many complicated stories, there&#8217;s never one simple answer. A&#47;C systems are a fickle breed. Your best bet is to have us inspect your system for any of the following listed symptoms.</p>
+<h3>From cold to hot and all the symptoms in between:</h3>
+<ul>
+ <li>The clogged expansion valve: The expansion valve distributes the proper amount of refrigerant to your evaporator. If the valve is blocked, the refrigerant can&#8217;t flow into the evaporator. With the valve clogged, the refrigerant will start to freeze the valve altogether if moisture is present.</li>
+ <li>Faulty compressor clutch: If the clutch is not engaging with your compressor, than your compressor can&#8217;t maintain the correct pressure. Hot air will result.</li>
+ <li>The blown fuse scenario: Fuses sometimes short out. If the fuse associated with your A&#47;C system goes, the power to certain parts will stop.</li>
+ <li>Leaks are an A&#47;C system&#8217;s worst friend: Leaks are the result of damage or the presence of moisture. When moisture and refrigerant mix, nasty corrosive acids will eat away at seals and components, causing a leak.</li>
+</ul>
+<h2>What is the smelly, gym locker odor coming from my A&#47;C vents&#63;</h2>
+<p>Sounds like you have an odorific problem on your hands. There are a few issues that may be causing this smell.</p>
+<h3>Potential causes of nasty &#8220;gym locker&#8221; odors:</h3>
+<ul>
+ <li>Dirty and old air cabin filter.</li>
+ <li>Moldy evaporator case. A problem for many vehicles when water sits in the evaporator case because the case&#8217;s drain is blocked. Mold will accumulate.</li>
+</ul>
+<h2>How do you test for an A&#47;C system leak&#63; </h2>
+<p>While we&#8217;re no <abbr title="Crime Scene Investigation">C.S.I.</abbr> unit, the ways to detect an A&#47;C system leak are not far off from an episode of the ever popular investigation show.</p>
+<h3>Detecting leaks:</h3>
+<ul>
+ <li>Black light enabled dyes. You read that right. A lot of refrigerants are pre&#45;mixed with a special <abbr title="ultraviolet">U.V.</abbr> dye that shows up under black light. We&#8217;ll run a black light over your A&#47;C system to see if any dye shows up.</li>
+ <li>Bring in the &#8220;sniffer.&#8221; A sniffer is a special device that hones in on the refrigerant&#8217;s chemical components. If there&#8217;s a leak, our sniffer will sniff it out.</li>
+</ul>
+<h2>What causes an A&#47;C system leak&#63;</h2>
+<p>Age and moisture. Plain and simple. Rubber seals and hoses can also lose their elasticity over time and breakdown allowing Freon to escape and moisture to enter your vehicle&#8217;s A&#47;C system. Moisture is the kiss of death for your A&#47;C system, mixing with refrigerant and creating a system destroying corrosive acid.</p>
+<p>Quick fact: If moisture is present, it could damage your accumulator, receiver or drier. Remember, these devices are responsible for removing moisture from the A&#47;C system and will eventually stop functioning once they are exposed to an open system &#40;leak or crack&#41;.</p>]]>

+<![CDATA[<h2>How does Firestone Complete Auto Care inspect my A&#47;C system&#63;</h2>
+<p>We use a customized machine &#40;<strong>RTI RHS980</strong>&#41; that has been specifically designed to test and diagnose any and all automotive A&#47;C problems. If we suspect a leak we&#8217;ll install a special <abbr title="ultraviolet">UV</abbr> Dye visible by black light or use &#8220;<q>sniffer</q>&#8221; to detect leaks. This device is run along the outside of your A&#47;C system parts and can detect any refrigerant fumes and residue that have breached the A&#47;C system.</p>
+<h2>Do I need an appointment to have my A&#47;C inspected&#63;</h2>
+<p>Stay cool. An appointment isn&#8217;t necessary to provide a comprehensive A&#47;C Performance Check, but a service appointment can be made for your convenience.</p>
+<p><a href="/appointment/">Schedule an A&#47;C Performance Check</a>.</p>
+<h2>How long does an A&#47;C Performance Check take&#63;</h2>
+<p>Well, you&#8217;ve guessed it, most A&#47;C repairs occur during the hottest days of the year. Let&#8217;s just say, when it rains it pours car A&#47;C repairs. And when the weather heats up is usually when most people realize their A&#47;C isn&#8217;t working. The inspection and testing process alone can take at least 30 minutes&#8212;and that&#8217;s if there is no problem or it&#8217;s an easy problem to spot &#40;are you feeling lucky&#63;&#41;.</p>
+<p>In many cases, should any work be required on your A&#47;C system, you&#8217;ll have the convenience of having the recommended services performed that same day. So don&#8217;t sweat it. No additional appointments are necessary. We&#8217;ve all got busy lives. Drop your vehicle off and we&#8217;ll give you a ring when it&#8217;s done so you can get on with your day while your vehicle is getting the full A&#47;C treatment. Want to wait&#63; Pull up a chair in our cozy customer lounge and chill out in our A&#47;C while we fix your A&#47;C.</p>
+<h2>Why do I need A&#47;C in the winter&#63;</h2>
+<p>Because scraping the inside of your windows is even less fun than scraping the outside&#33; Seriously, not only does your air conditioning system provide cool air in the summer, it also de&#45;humidifies the air, eliminating moisture when you&#8217;re running the defroster in the winter. A properly functioning A&#47;C system is especially important in the winter to eliminate moisture that fogs up or freezes on the inside of the glass preventing you from seeing clearly.</p>
+<p>Get rid of your winter A&#47;C frustrations.</p>

+<h2>Do you service A&#47;C systems on Hybrid Vehicles&#63;</h2>
+<p>If your Hybrid is equipped with a standard, belt&#45;driven A&#47;C compressor, then we can service your vehicle.</p>
+<p>Note&#58; <strong>Currently, we do not service Hybrid vehicles with electrically driven A&#47;C compressors.</strong></p>
+<h2>What special equipment do you use when servicing my A&#47;C system&#63;</h2>
+<p>The <strong>RTI RHS980</strong> is the brains behind the complicated equations and chemical analysis performed during an A&#47;C system test. This machine is standard in all our Firestone locations and is the most trusted and accurate way to detect any potential A&#47;C system problems. Without this equipment, a lot of hard to detect problems would either go unnoticed or take a lot longer to detect.</p>
+<h2>How are Firestone technicians trained to service A&#47;C systems&#63;</h2>
+<p>Not any technician off the street can service an A&#47;C system. Really. it&#8217;s the law. Any person that wants to service an A&#47;C system must first receive proper training and pass a certification test conducted by the Mobile Air Conditioning Society &#40;<abbr title="Mobile Air Conditioning Society">MACS</abbr>&#41;.</p>
+<p>MACS was created in 1990 after the <abbr title="Environmental Protection Agency">EPA</abbr> required special certification for any technician servicing any A&#47;C systems. The MACS certification test is designed to gauge the technician&#8217;s knowledge on properly recovering and recycling refrigerant. Refrigerant is a highly volatile and dangerous substance requiring certification by the EPA.</p>
+<p>Although the MACS test is not designed to evaluate the skills necessary to repair or service an A&#47;C system, here at Firestone Complete Auto Care, we go a step further.</p>
+<p>With our own onsite training, our technicians receive the complete training regimen necessary to understand and successfully recharge and repair any car, truck or <abbr title="sport utility vehicle">SUV</abbr> A&#47;C system part.</p>

+<headline><![CDATA[FAQs About Your Car&#8217;s Cabin, Fuel and Air Filters]]></headline>
+<content>
+<![CDATA[<h2>What does an air filter, cabin air filter or fuel filter do&#63;</h2>
+<p>All auto filters are designed to prevent harmful debris from entering any parts where air and fluid flows, including your engine, radiator, fuel lines and more. Once a filter is no longer performing its intended function, decreased performance &#8211; even engine damage &#8211; can result.</p>
+<p>You&#8217;ve been reaping the benefits of filters your entire life. If you&#8217;ve ever used a furnace or air conditioning system at home, you&#8217;ve had to replace a filter from time to time. If you haven&#8217;t, well, you might want to go and check those out too. You can send us a thank you letter later &#8211; if you want.</p>
+<p><strong>In the meantime, here&#8217;s what each automotive filter does&#58;</strong></p>
+<p><strong>Air filter&#58;</strong> Prevents harmful debris, dirt and contaminants from entering your engine.</p>
+<p><strong>Cabin filter&#58;</strong> An implementation that began appearing in vehicles in 2002, it prevents dust, pollen, dirt and other pollutants from entering your car through your A&#47;C and heat vents.</p>
+<p><strong>Fuel Filter&#58;</strong> Keeps dirt, debris and contaminants from clogging your fuel lines and causing erratic, unstable fuel performance and reduced fuel economy.</p>
+<h2>How often should an air, cabin air or fuel filter be replaced&#63;</h2>
+<p>Generally, it&#8217;s recommended that you get your filters replaced every 12 months or 12,000 miles, but check your owner&#8217;s manual for specifics about your vehicle&#8217;s filter replacement schedules.</p>
+<p>Time for a filter replacement&#63; <a href="/appointment/">Schedule an appointment</a>.</p>
+<h2>What happens to air, cabin air or fuel filters as they get older&#63;</h2>
+<p>Any filter &#8211; home, auto or otherwise &#8211; will eventually age and become contaminated with pollutants and debris. When that happens, the filter loses its effectiveness and hinders the performance of the parts it is supposed to protect.</p>
+<p>When your air filter is dirty, your engine is forced to work harder, resulting in poor fuel economy, higher emissions and, possibly, a loss of engine power. In turn, as a worst&#45;case scenario, a clogged cabin air filter can lead to under&#45;performance of the A&#47;C system, causing weak air flow from the cabin vents. It can also lead to unwanted, unfiltered air in the cabin. As for a mucked&#45;up fuel filter, that&#8217;ll land you with a weakened fuel supply to injectors, a reduction in engine power, poor acceleration and lousy fuel economy &#8211; not to mention a potential breakdown.</p>
+<p>Replace old filters to avoid placing stress on other vital car parts.</p>

+<h2>What is the benefit of replacing an air, cabin air or fuel filter&#63;</h2>
+<p>The benefits are car&#45;saving and performance&#45;enhancing. They protect vital car parts by keeping harmful debris at bay so your car runs right. Filters also ensure your car runs more efficiently. The cleaner your filter, the more it allows for the maximum flow of air or fluid through the system. Like a clogged drain, a dirty filter starves the system of the vital air or fluid and makes each system it protects work harder to do its job. Once filters are dirtied, they should be replaced.</p>
+<p><strong>The purpose of each filter is clear&#58; to trap and protect.</strong></p>
+<p>Air filter&#58; Engine protection is the name of the game. So is engine performance. <a href="http://www.osti.gov/bridge" rel="external nofollow">Acceleration can improve up to 11&#37;</a> after an old, dirty air filter is replaced. Our Purolator Classic air filters are engineered to trap 96.5&#37; of harmful contaminants that can damage your engine.&#42;</p>
+<p class="legal">&#42;Based on <abbr title="International Organization for Standardization">ISO</abbr> 5011 on A13192</p>
+<p><span class="block"><strong>Cabin air filter&#58;</strong></span> <strong>Made to prevent outside allergens and dust from entering your ride&#8217;s air vents.</strong> The benefit&#58; it keeps the air that you breathe inside the cabin clean. They&#8217;re engineered to trap a whole bunch of things, including pollen, dust, mold spores, smoke, soot and smog &#8211; none of which belong in your nose.
+</p>
+<p><span class="block"><strong>Fuel filter&#58;</strong></span> <strong>The cleaner the fuel system, the more efficiently your vehicle will operate.</strong> Even a slight reduction in fuel flow can affect your vehicle&#8217;s overall performance and fuel economy. With a new fuel filter, you typically notice a boost in fuel efficiency and overall performance. And with the cost of gas these days, that savings can be significant.
+</p>
+<p>Time for new filters&#63; <a href="/appointment/">Schedule an appointment</a>.</p>
+<h2>What are some symptoms that indicate my vehicle&#8217;s air, cabin air or fuel filter may benefit from a replacement&#63;</h2>
+<p>Once a filter is old and full of crud, you&#8217;ll notice a decline in your vehicle&#8217;s operation. Filters are all about ensuring clean and pure performance. If you see a drop in fuel economy, a decrease in power and performance or notice the A&#47;C and heating system just doesn&#8217;t appear to be working as well, it may be time to replace one or more filters.</p>
+<p><span class="block"><strong>Spot the symptom. Replace the filter.</strong></span> <strong>Air filter&#58;</strong> Old and dirty air filters lead to reduced engine power, decreased throttle response, weaker acceleration and increased engine wear. Sounds ugly. Well, it is, and you should have it replaced when it gets bad.
+</p>
+<p><strong>Cabin air filter&#58;</strong> As time passes, you may notice air flowing through your vents is weaker. This happens when the filter is REALLY mucked&#45;up &#8212; in the worst case. You may also notice that there is a difference in air quality in the cabin when you&#8217;re on the road. This may be the result of unwanted, unfiltered air entering the cabin because the filter is dirty. Hah&#45;choo&#33;</p>
+<p><strong>Fuel filter&#58;</strong> Replace your fuel filter if you start noticing reduced MPGs or sluggish engine performance &#40;sputtering horsepower, dragging&#41;. Avoid these situations by replacing your fuel filter, regularly. If you delay a fuel filter replacement, you could clog a fuel injector completely with dirt or debris, cutting off fuel from the engine and making it stop. Now, that&#8217;s bad news.</p>

+<h2>How long does it take to replace the filters on my vehicle&#63;</h2>
+<p>Times vary, but most filters can be replaced quickly, provided they&#8217;re in an easy&#45;to&#45;reach place. However, more and more of today&#8217;s vehicle manufacturers are placing filters in trickier locations, largely for design and space efficiency purposes. Hard to reach filters ultimately require extra service time when they need replacement. If this is the case, we&#8217;ll keep you informed on how long it will take.</p>
+<p>Hard or easy to access, we&#8217;ll replace your filter and have you on your way as soon as possible.</p>

+<content>
+<![CDATA[<h2>What does a serpentine belt do&#63;</h2>
+<p>Well, it won&#8217;t keep your pants up, but does transport power to your vital automotive components. The serpentine belt is one long, snaking, winding belt that keeps your alternator, power steering pump, air conditioning and &#8212; in some cases &#8212; your water pump running smoothly and effectively.</p>
+<h2>Didn&#8217;t cars used to have more than one belt&#63;</h2>
+<p>Back in the day, cars had individual belts for many components. Though each belt could be replaced individually, these cars experienced inconsistent or compromised performance as individual belts began to wear down. Now that vehicles employ a single belt &#8211; the serpentine belt &#8211; that&#8217;s no longer an issue. That said, it&#8217;s critical that regular inspections are done to make sure the belt is in good shape.</p>
+<h2>How often does a serpentine belt need to be replaced&#63;</h2>
+<p>Serpentine belts are built to last &#8211; much longer than before because of advancements in rubber technology. Under ideal conditions, a belt should stick with you for an average of 60,000 to 100,000 miles. Pretty impressive. However, some belts are manually tensioned and may need to be adjusted. Others have a self&#45;tensioning mechanism that can experience wear over time and may need to be serviced. One thing to remember&#58; in most cases, if the belt breaks, the vehicle will stop running.</p>
+<p>Need your engine belt inspected or replaced&#63; <a href="/appointment/">Schedule an appointment</a>.</p>
+<h2>How many belts do most vehicles have&#63;</h2>
+<p>Today, there&#8217;s one belt to run them all &#8212; well, for the majority of vehicles. It&#8217;s called the serpentine belt. Some rides may have an additional belt to run select accessories, but the serpentine does the bulk of the work. Before this all&#45;in&#45;one serpentine solution, cars were equipped with many different belts to power individual parts and components.</p>
+<p>Get your engine belt inspected or replaced. <a href="/appointment/">Schedule an appointment</a>.</p>
+<h2>What happens as a belt gets older&#63;</h2>
+<p>They can wear, fray, crack or become shiny or &#8220;glazed,&#8221; and rubber parts can peel off the belt. An aging belt can also begin slipping or squealing, become contaminated with fluid or become misaligned, in which case it will need to be replaced. An old belt can even snap, leaving you up the creek; without one, drive torque to all of the engine&#8217;s accessories is lost.</p>

+<h2>What is the benefit of having a belt replaced&#63;</h2>
+<p>Driving on an old belt is a disaster waiting to happen because it powers most all of an engine&#8217;s accessories. That means when your belt breaks, slips and, ultimately, wears out, everything &#8211; from the power steering pump to the alternator and air conditioner &#8211; stops working. What&#8217;s more, the parts it controls can become severely damaged. Broken hoses and belts are bad; a damaged engine is even worse. By replacing your belt periodically, you can minimize the risk of breakdown.</p>
+<p><strong>Make time to have your belt inspected</strong>.</p>
+<p>An annual car inspection or a visual inspection during an oil change is good way to determine your belt&#8217;s current condition, while giving you an idea of when it needs replacement.</p>
+<p>Drive with peace of mind. Have your belt inspected. <a href="/appointment/">Schedule an appointment</a>.</p>
+<h2>What is a &#8220;belt tensioner,&#8221; and what is the benefit of replacing it when a belt is replaced&#63;</h2>
+<p>Many of today&#8217;s vehicles are equipped with a self&#45;tensioning device called an automatic belt tensioner. These tensioners are designed to hold a predetermined amount of tension on the serpentine belt so it functions properly and keeps your car cruising.</p>
+<p>Your serpentine belt is like one giant, fast&#45;spinning rubber band. And, like a rubber band, it must maintain a balance of flexibility and tension. Most tensioners feature an internal spring and pulley, which applies needed force against the serpentine belt to keep it tight. If there is not enough tension, a belt can slip, squeal or run hot. Worst&#45;case scenario&#58; a loose belt may come off of its pulleys. When this happens, all the accessories powered by the engine go kaput and the vehicle will stop running.</p>
+<p><strong>Quick fact</strong>&#58; If your serpentine belt is loose, you may have other mechanical problems like under&#45;performing water pump, which can cause the engine to overheat. Avoid performance loss. Bring your ride in as soon as possible. We&#8217;ll take care of you.</p>
+<p>Need your serpentine belt checked out&#63; <a href="/appointment/">Schedule an appointment today</a>.</p>
+<h2>How many different types of belts are there&#63;</h2>
+<p>A serpentine belt is the most common belt in today&#8217;s cars &#8211; it controls the functionality of most every system for your car. Alternately, your ride may feature a series of V&#45;belts &#40;also known as a fan belts&#41;, which perform the same all&#45;purpose functions as a serpentine belt. Some vehicle&#8217;s may also have a &#8220;toothed&#8221; timing belt in the engine that is key to your overall engine performance. This belt may drive the water, oil pumps and other key parts.</p>
+<h2>What are symptoms my vehicle&#8217;s belt may require a belt replacement&#63;</h2>
+<ul>
+    <li><strong>Chirp or squeal&#58;</strong> When a belt begins slipping, a squealing sound may occur. This is the result of the belt and pulley not working correctly, low belt tension or belt stretch and/or wear. Oil and antifreeze leaks can also contribute to belt slippage. If you hear these sounds, you need to have your ride inspected as soon as possible before further malfunctions occur. And with this sound, they eventually will.</li>
+    <li><strong>System performance loss&#58;</strong> Maybe your power steering has failed, your battery suddenly drains or your engine just stops. All these things are controlled by a properly functioning serpentine or V&#45;belt. Once your belt is compromised, it can produce further damage to the vital systems &#8211; such as the alternator, water pump, power steering and air conditioning &#8211; that depend on it. Unfortunately, the resulting damage can require extensive repair, with very little warning leading up to the event.</li>
+    <li><strong>Check engine light illumination&#58;</strong> This may be an indication something is wrong with the belt.</li>
+</ul>
+<p><strong>Funny noises</strong> may be related to problems with other parts. Never ignore a noise. Where there&#8217;s a noise, there&#8217;s a potential problem. Have your ride inspected and keep your four&#45;wheel investment protected.</p>
+<p>Don&#8217;t ignore the warnings of belt failure. <a href="/appointment/">Schedule an appointment for an inspection</a>.</p>

+    <h2>October Car Care Month Facts</h2>
+    <h3>Life &#40;and car care&#41; is easier when you know the facts.</h3>
+<ol class="date-list">
+    <li><span>October<span>1</span></span>Saving money on gas is a good thing. So is maintaining correct tire pressure. This way, you can achieve a 10 percent boost gas savings, according to the <a href="http://www.aaa.com" rel="external nofollow">American Automobile Association.</a> Since needs vary by vehicle, though, check your owner&#8217;s manual for the proper air pressure for your foursome.</li>
+    <li><span>October<span>2</span></span>File this under &#8220;who knew&#63;&#8221; &#40;Okay, we do.&#41; The &#8220;W&#8221; in your type of oil stands for &#8220;winter.&#8221; And the number before the &#8220;W&#8221; &#40;i.e. <abbr title="Society of Automotive Engineers">SAE</abbr> 5W30&#41; lets you know how easily this oil will pump at low temperatures. 0W is for very low temperatures, and higher numbers like 10W are designed for milder winter weather.</li>
+    <li><span>October<span>3</span></span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Verbiest" rel="external nofollow">Ferdinand Verbiest</a> built the first automobile in 1668. It was a two&#45;foot&#45;long, steam&#45;powered number. How&#8217;s that for proof we&#8217;ve come a long way&#63;</li>
+    <li><span>October<span>4</span></span>Some symptoms your car&#8217;s alignment could be off&#58; your vehicle is pulling to the left or right; you have uneven or rapid tire wear; your steering wheel is crooked when driving straight; or your tires squeal. If any of these ring true, it&#8217;s time for help.</li>
+    <li><span>October<span>5</span></span>The term &#8220;coolant&#8221; is a bit misleading. The truth is, coolant doesn&#8217;t simply control your engine from running hot. It also regulates engine temperature during colder weather. Considering cooler weather is coming, it&#8217;s time to do something about that.</li>
+    <li><span>October<span>6</span></span>Tire inflation levels are measured in <abbr title="pounds per square inch">psi</abbr> &#40;pounds per square inch&#41;. Because air pressure can decrease up to 10 psi a month just through every day driving and may potentially drop 1 psi for every 10 degrees Fahrenheit temperature drop, it&#8217;s important to ready your ride.</li>
+    <li><span>October<span>7</span></span>After seeing snow and rain gathered on trolley cars and automobile windows, Mary Anderson invented the first windshield wipers in 1905. She may not have been the first to notice, but she sure was the first to do something about it. And for that, we thank her.</li>
+    <li><span>October<span>8</span></span>Motor oil keeps your engine lubricated and helps control engine temperatures in both hot and cold weather. Yep, that means changing it is just as important during cold weather as it is when it&#8217;s hot.</li>
+    <li><span>October<span>9</span></span>If you have snow and ice tires, it&#8217;s time for a switcheroo. Think you need a set&#63; <a href="/tires/blizzak/">Blizzaks</a> have your back.</li>
+    <li><span>October<span>10</span></span><a href="http://www.snopes.com/legal/et.asp" rel="external nofollow">Rumor has it,</a> Title 14, Section 1211, of the Code of Federal Regulations once subjected US citizens to a quarantine if they interacted with extraterrestrial vehicles and/or drivers. That&#8217;s right&#58; no mingling with martians, at least not prior to 1991.</li>
+    <li><span>October<span>11</span></span>Snow. Slush. Slippery roads. It&#8217;s no secret stopping power is more important than ever during less&#45;than&#45;ideal winter conditions. Get your brakes checked before the weather turns.</li>
+    <li><span>October<span>12</span></span>It&#8217;s a simple fact&#58; replacing spent spark plugs helps increase fuel economy. The National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence found spark plugs that misfire can reduce fuel efficiency by 30&#37;&#42;. If new plugs are installed at specific intervals, there&#8217;s a very good chance you&#8217;ll maximize fuel economy and save money at the pump. What&#8217;s more, a recent study by the Environmental Protection Agency, says it plays a role in lowering air pollution as well.
+&#42; <a href="http://www.ase.com/News-Events/Publications/Car-Care-Articles/It-s-Easy-Being--Green-.aspx" rel="external nofollow">ASE It&#8217;s Easy Being Green</a></li>
+    <li><span>October<span>13</span></span>In 2011, Americans <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/story/2011-12-07/americans-driving-less/51716466/1" rel="external nofollow">drove less,</a> with six consecutive monthly decreases for the first time since 2008. The reason&#63; High gas prices. Reduce pain at the pump with a properly maintained, fuel&#45;efficient ride.</li>
+    <li><span>October<span>14</span></span>When it comes to the fluid exchanges your vehicle needs, check your owner&#8217;s manual for specific change intervals since most vary by vehicle. You can also use our tool to <a href="/maintenance/schedule.jsp">check your make and model&#8217;s general service intervals.</a></li>
+    <li><span>October<span>15</span></span>Battery power can wind up severely depleted from hot weather. The problem is you might not even know it until the weather turns chilly. That&#8217;s why a <a href="/cf/batteries/everything-you-need-to-know-about-car-batteries/">battery check</a> is due.</li>
+    <li><span>October<span>16</span></span>Clearing your trunk of the extra junk can work wonders when it comes to preserving your rotors and other brake parts. The reason is extra weight puts extra stress on your brakes when you stop. It also affects how quickly you can stop. So take out the sports equipment, shoes and other errant junk in your trunk.</li>
+    <li><span>October<span>17</span></span>Firestone Complete Auto Care has over 1,600 stores nationwide. That&#8217;s about the same amount of paintings rendered by Picasso during his eighty&#45;plus year career. Now ya know.</li>
+    <li><span>October<span>18</span></span>Let&#8217;s do the math&#58; it costs more to replace brake rotors than it does to swap tired brake pads. So before the first signs of brake trouble, get them inspected. What is a brake rotor, you ask&#63; It&#8217;s directly connected to each wheel. To stop your car, the rotor must stop spinning, and the friction caused by the brake pad makes this happen.</li>
+    <li><span>October<span>19</span></span>An &#8220;ED&#45;18&#8221; test on your battery is an &#8220;early detection&#8221; test, and it gauges how much life your battery has left. This test is crucial in determining whether or not you need a new battery.</li>
+    <li><span>October<span>20</span></span>Even the slightest misalignment from hitting potholes and normal wear and tear can lead to premature tire wear &#8211; even if your car&#8217;s alignment is off by 100th of a degree or inch. When this happens, it can lead to further misalignment and the need to replace your tires sooner than you hoped.</li>
+    <li><span>October<span>21</span></span>These days, cars are more fuel&#45;efficient than ever. But gas is also much, much more expensive than it used to be. In 2011 alone, the <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/45727242/Missing_4_155_It_Went_Into_Your_Gas_Tank_This_Year" rel="external nofollow">average American spent &#36;4,155</a> filling up at the pump. That&#8217;s a whole lot of yikes. And it&#8217;s a good reason to maintain your ride.</li>
+    <li><span>October<span>22</span></span>Accessories you plug into your car can drain your car battery. So, unplug the phone charger, iPod or tablet since it may be sucking the life out of your ride&#8217;s battery. The last thing you want is a car that won&#8217;t start because the battery is dead.</li>
+    <li><span>October<span>23</span></span>The thickness of your oil can affect fuel efficiency. It takes more energy &#40;fuel burned&#41; to pump thicker oil versus to thinner oil. More energy usage equals less fuel efficiency. Many newer vehicles run on lower viscosity oils. The lighter the oil, the less energy required to pump it. For optimal performance use the grade of oil recommended in your owner&#8217;s manual.</li>
+    <li><span>October<span>24</span></span>Kangaroos can grow up to be six feet tall and weigh over 200 pounds. Like most humans, they&#8217;d also have trouble fitting into a tiny smart car.</li>
+    <li><span>October<span>25</span></span>Strategic, periodic transmission fluid exchanges help clear your system of impurities. A clean transmission system is free to do its job &#8211; cooling and lubricating the transmission&#8217;s moving parts. Whether for manual or automatic transmission, transmission fluid protects transmission parts and makes it possible to switch gears smoothly.</li>
+    <li>
+            <span>October<span>26</span></span>Time for a fast fact. An air filter protects your engine from dirt and debris. And you can see an 11&#37; improvement in acceleration after replacing a dirty air filter with a new one.&#42; Our Purolator Classic air filters catch up to 95&#37; of harmful contaminants.&#42;&#42;

+    <li><span>October<span>27</span></span>A not so fun fact&#58; Condensation and moisture buildup inside the casings of your car bulbs &#40;headlights, brake lights, etc.&#41; account for most burnouts. Not good.</li>
+    <li><span>October<span>28</span></span>Bad sounds can be signs that your brakes need work. When you push down the brake pedal, do you hear screeching, grinding, rubbing or squealing&#63; These sounds may mean your brake pads need work or your rotors need replacing.</li>
+    <li><span>October<span>29</span></span>Put a penny in your tire tread grooves with the top of Abe&#8217;s head facing down. If you can see the top of his head, that tire is spent and needs to be replaced. Honestly.</li>
+    <li><span>October<span>30</span></span>Bridgestone&#8217;s high&#45;performance Blizzak line includes snow and ice tires for nearly every type of consumer vehicle. And they can stop a 30&#45;mile&#45;per&#45;hour vehicle an average of 35 feet sooner on ice than all&#45;season radials can. Yep, that&#8217;s about two car&#45;lengths sooner.</li>
+    <li><span>October<span>31</span></span>Today is the last day you can get Firestone Complete Auto Care&#8217;s Complete Vehicle Inspection special. Swing by and get one so your car is ready for the winter months ahead.

+<content>
+<![CDATA[<p>Bridgestone Winter Driving School Director and Pro Race Driver Mark Cox lives and drives in the extreme winter conditions of Steamboat Springs, Colorado. Cox has helped Bridgestone Americas Tire Operations pull together the best strategic winter driving tips to take your vehicle on its snow&#45;laden drive this winter and to help you and your family reach your destinations safely.</p>
+    <h2>Before You Drive</h2>
+    <h3>Check windshield wiper blades to make sure they work properly.</h3>
+<p>In some areas, snow blades are an effective alternative to conventional wiper blades.</p>
+<h3>Have your mechanic test the anti&#45;freeze&#47;coolant.</h3>
+<p>This will provide the correct level of protection required in your driving area.</p>
+<h3>Use dedicated snow and ice tires if you live in areas where snow and ice are certainties of winter driving.</h3>
+<p>Snow and ice tires have a softer tread compound and a unique tread design to provide enhanced traction and road&#45;gripping capabilities. Install snow tires all the way around the vehicle, not just on the drive axle.</p>
+<h3>Keep your gas tank at least half&#45;full.</h3>
+<p>The extra volume can help reduce moisture problems within your fuel system. It also adds a margin of safety should you become stopped or stranded during your trip.</p>
+<h3>Try to remove ice and snow from your shoes before getting in your vehicle.</h3>
+<p>As snow and ice melt they can create moisture build&#45;up, causing windows to fog on the inside of the vehicle.</p>
+<h3>Scrape the ice and snow from every window of the vehicle.</h3>
+<p>And the exterior rear view mirrors, not just a small patch on the windshield. Don&#8217;t forget to clean the headlights and brake lights.</p>
+<h3>Buckle up.</h3>
+<p>You and your passengers should always use safety belts including lap and shoulder straps. Pull them snugly to ensure they work properly.</p>
+<h3>Adjust headrests.</h3>
+<p>Position the driver or passenger&#8217;s head rests squarely in the center of the headrest. Rear&#45;end collisions are common in winter driving and a properly adjusted headrest can prevent, or reduce, neck injuries.</p>
+<h3>Turn off your radio.</h3>
+<p>Although your radio can provide helpful traffic information, it can also be a distraction for some drivers. Remember, driving is AS MUCH a mental skill as a physical skill.</p>
+<h3>Stay off your cell phone.</h3>
+<p>Even if you have a hands&#45;free model, you need to concentrate on driving, not on a telephone conversation, when driving on ice or snow.</p>
+<h3>Keep your vehicle stocked with simple emergency equipment.</h3>
+<p>In case you do get stalled or have an accident.</p>
+<h3>Know the weather where you are, where you&#8217;re going and everywhere in between.</h3>
+<p>If snow or ice is predicted, make plans to leave early or arrive later. An alarm clock set to an earlier time can be a good friend in helping you avoid difficulties.</p>
+<h3>If you can move a night trip to daylight hours, do so.</h3>
+<p>Not only is visibility better during daylight, but if your vehicle is stalled, you are more likely to receive prompt assistance during the daytime.</p>
+<h3>Before you shift into gear, plan the best route to your destination.</h3>
+<p>Avoid hills, high congestion areas and bridges if possible.</p>
+<h2>Consider Keeping These Items in Your Vehicle&#58;</h2>
+<ol>
+    <li>A blanket or extra clothes</li>
+    <li>A candle with matches</li>
+    <li>Snacks</li>
+    <li>Beverages &#40;never alcohol&#41;</li>

+    <h2>When You Drive</h2>
+    <h3>Adjust your speed to the current conditions.</h3>
+<p>When driving in challenging conditions, decreasing your speed will allow more time to respond when a difficult situation arises. Factors such as the type of vehicle you are driving, the quality of tires your car is equipped with, and your abilities as a driver should be considered in the speed adjustment. Remember that posted speed limits identify the maximum speed allowed when weather conditions are ideal. Law enforcement agencies can write citations to motorists driving the posted speed limit if weather conditions warrant a slower speed.</p>
+<h3>Anticipate difficult situations.</h3>
+<p>Studies have shown that 80&#37; of all accidents could be prevented with only one more second to react. In many situations, this one second can be gained by looking far enough down the road to identify problems before you become a part of them. Be more alert to the actions of other drivers. Anticipate vehicles coming from side streets and put extra distance between your vehicle and the one in front of you. If someone is too close behind you, don&#8217;t speed up; slow down and let them go around you.</p>
+<h3>Use grip effectively.</h3>
+<p>When roads are slippery, use all of the grip available. Brake only before the curve when the car is traveling straight. Taking your foot off the brake before you steer into the curve allows you to use all of the grip available for steering. Don&#8217;t accelerate until you begin to straighten the steering wheel when exiting the turn. This technique will allow you to be 100&#37; effective at each maneuver. In many situations, better grip or traction can be gained by placing the outside wheels toward the shoulder of the road, out of the ruts in the center. The difference in traction can unbalance the car during the transition from rut to shoulder &#8212; so be alert.</p>
+<h3>Maintain a comfortable driving environment.</h3>
+<p>A constant flow of cool air will help keep you alert, and keep the windows clear of frost. Keeping one window slightly open will allow you to hear sirens and other warning sounds more quickly. When driving, avoid large bulky boots, gloves and coats, and never drive in ski boots.</p>
+<h3>Turn on your lights.</h3>
+<p>When daytime visibility is less than ideal, turning on your lights allows you to see, and to be seen by others. Remember this rule of thumb. Wipers On &#8212; Lights On.</p>
+<h3>When driving at night, leave your head lamps on low beam when driving in snow or fog.</h3>
+<p>This practice minimizes the reflection and glare, improves visibility, and reduces eye fatigue. When oncoming cars approach, focus on the right side of the roadway to help maintain good night vision.</p>
+<h3>Keep a smooth, progressive and light touch on the brakes for normal braking.</h3>
+<p>Even in a car equipped with <abbr title="Anti&#45;Lock Braking System">ABS</abbr> &#40;Anti&#45;Lock Braking System&#41;. In the event of an emergency in an ABS&#45;equipped car, press the pedal HARD and hold it down. Remember that in an ABS&#45;equipped car, you can also steer around many obstacles while braking. Perhaps a better description of ABS would be&#58; &#8220;Allows you to Brake and Steer.&#8221;</p>
+<h3>Keep both hands on the wheel.</h3>
+<p>At 9 o&#8217;clock and 3 o&#8217;clock positions, and steer smoothly in the direction that you want to go. Avoid the &#8220;hand over hand technique.&#8221; Instead, utilize the shuffle technique and keep the right hand on the right side of the wheel and the left hand on the left side of the wheel. While this technique may sound overly simple, it can help you avoid skids.</p>
+<h3>Be careful when using downshifting as a way to slow the vehicle.</h3>
+<p>Even though manual transmissions may provide greater control to assist with braking, gear changes should always be made smoothly in the straightaway before the corner. Abrupt gear changes, especially while cornering, may upset a vehicle&#8217;s balance and cause a skid to occur.</p>
+<h3>Don&#8217;t overestimate the capability of four wheel drive vehicles.</h3>
+<p>Many drivers mistakenly believe that four wheel drive is all&#45;powerful. Every type of vehicle depends on four small contact patches where the tire meets the road for traction. These small areas are the only contact of your vehicle to the road. Four wheel drive does not improve braking or cornering effectiveness.</p>
+<h3>Anti&#45;lock brakes can&#8217;t perform miracles.</h3>
+<p>Don&#8217;t be misled by ABS braking systems. Braking efficiency is limited by the grip available, and the type of tires with which your car is equipped. If you carry too much speed into a corner and then try to brake, even ABS won&#8217;t keep you on the road. Never count on technology to replace good judgment.</p>
+<h3>Wear quality sunglasses.</h3>
+<p>Good quality sunglasses help highlight changes in the terrain and road surface even in low visibility conditions.</p>
+<h3>The world&#8217;s best drivers are trained to anticipate problems early.</h3>
+<p>And direct the vehicle appropriately before they become involved in a problem. Reacting too quickly can be dangerous if the driver&#8217;s response is inappropriate.</p>
+<h3>When driving up a steep hill in icy conditions, gain speed and momentum on the flat before starting uphill.</h3>
+<p>When the car begins to slow part way up the hill ease up on the accelerator, allow the car to slow down and crest the hill slowly. If you try and accelerate too hard and spin the wheels, you may lose momentum and not make it to the top. It&#8217;s better to make the top at a slower speed than to not make it at all.</p>
+<h3>If you do have trouble, and become stopped or stranded, run the engine only briefly &#8212; not continuously &#8212; to run the heater.</h3>
+<p>Regularly make sure that the exhaust pipe is clear of snowdrifts or other obstructions. Carbon monoxide can accumulate more easily in a non&#45;moving vehicle.</p>]]>

+<h2>Things to Know Before You Hit the Road</h2>
+<p>With holiday travel right around the corner, we know that you&#8217;ll be hitting the road more frequently and for longer distances. Knowing that, we want you to have all the tools to stay safe.</p>
+<h3>Make sure your tires are properly inflated.</h3>
+<p>Letting air out of tires to drive in snow can reduce the gripping action of tires because the tread will not meet the road surface as it was designed to do. Over&#45;inflation has the same effect.</p>
+<h3>Keep your gas tank at least half&#45;full.</h3>
+<p>The extra volume can help reduce moisture problems within your fuel system. It also adds a margin of safety should you become stopped or stranded during your trip.</p>
+<h3>Check windshield wiper blades to make sure they work properly.</h3>
+<p>There is nothing worse than getting a few miles into a rainy trip and realizing you can&#8217;t see well.</p>
+<h3>Give your car a once over.</h3>
+<p>By checking all fluids, hoses and lights before leaving you can hit the road with peace of mind.</p> 
+<h3>Consider keeping these items in your vehicle&#58;</h3>
+<ol>
+    <li>A blanket or extra clothes</li>
+    <li>A candle with matches</li>
+    <li>Snacks</li>
+    <li>Water</li>
+    <li>Flares</li>
+    <li><abbr title="Citizens&#8217; Band">C.B.</abbr> radio, cellular phone or hand radio</li>
+    <li>Long jumper cables</li>
+    <li>A small shovel </li>
+    <li>A flashlight</li>
+    <li>A windshield scraping device </li>
+    <li>A tow rope</li>
+    <li>A bag of sand or cat litter for traction</li>
+</ol>
+<h2>Snow Driving Tips</h2>
+<p>And if you are one of the lucky &#40;or unlucky, depending on how you look at it&#41; people that will be driving in cold temperatures, sleet and snow here&#8217;s what you need to know&#33;</p>
+<h3>Use dedicated snow and ice tires if you live in areas where snow and ice are certainties of winter driving.</h3>
+<p>Snow and ice tires have a softer tread compound and a unique tread design to provide enhanced traction and road&#45;gripping capabilities. Install snow tires all the way around the vehicle, not just on the drive axle. <a href="/tires/blizzak/">More information on Blizzak snow tires.</a></p>
+<h3>Have your mechanic test the anti&#45;freeze&#47;coolant.</h3>
+<p>This will provide the correct level of protection required in your driving area. <a href="/appointment/">Schedule an appointment now.</a></p>
+<h3>Try to remove ice and snow from your shoes before getting in your vehicle.</h3>
+<p>As snow and ice melt they can create moisture build&#45;up, causing windows to fog on the inside of the vehicle.</p>
+<h3>Scrape the ice and snow from every window of the vehicle.</h3>
+<p>And scrape exterior rear view mirrors, not just a small patch on the windshield. Don&#8217;t forget to clean the headlights and brake lights.</p> 
+<h3>During winter months, know the weather where you are, where you&#8217;re going and everywhere in between.</h3>
+<p>If snow or ice is predicted, make plans to leave early or arrive later. An alarm clock set to an earlier time can be a good friend in helping you avoid difficulties.</p>
+<h3>4 wheel drives slip on the ice just as much as 2 wheel drives.</h3>
+<p>So slow down on ice, 4x4s&#33;</p>
+<h3>Wash your car on moderately warm days in the early part of the day.</h3>
+<p>This will prevent windows and doors from icing up overnight. In the extreme cold avoid the car wash. Road salt doesn&#8217;t work in these temperatures, thus your car won&#8217;t rust.</p>
+<h3>There&#8217;s a different grade of windshield washer fluid to use in the winter.</h3>
+<p>It&#8217;s a bit more expensive, but will not freeze in temperatures below 32 degrees.</p>
+<h3>Starting your engine and letting it warm up prior to driving is a good idea.</h3>
+<p>Keep in mind that although your engine may be warm and ready to run, other parts&#47;fluids of your car are still cold. For instance, take it easy on your steering pump &#8211; the steering fluid is still cold and will warm up only after use. Drive slowly for a few blocks after pulling out of the driveway to give your car a chance to loosen up &#40;much like you need after waking up in the morning&#41;. This will significantly reduce wear and tear on your car in the long run.</p>
+<h3>Be careful when digging out of the snow.</h3>
+<p>Shoveling can be very tough on your body. A lot of heart attacks happen this way. Also, if you are all alone, take off a few layers before shoveling to prevent sweating &#8211; the last thing you need is hypothermia. Sweat is your enemy. Lift with the knees, not your back.</p>
